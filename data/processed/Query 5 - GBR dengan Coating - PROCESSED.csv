Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) addresses these defects using barrier membranes that block soft tissue infiltration and promote bone growth. CollaTape®, a type I bovine collagen membrane, is widely used for its biocompatibility and resorbability, though its bioactivity and antibacterial properties could be improved. This study compares two functionalization methods for enhancing CollaTape® membranes: adsorption of GBMP1α peptide (a BMP-2 biomimetic) and covalent anchoring of its analogue Aoa-GBMP1α. Both functionalizations were performed at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/mL. Optimal conditions were selected basing on osteoblast mineralization assays and resulted to be 0.25 mg/mL for adsorption and 1.5 mg/mL for covalent binding. Peptide surface density analysis revealed values of 0.040 μmol/cm² for adsorption and 0.278 μmol/cm² for covalent anchoring. Biological assays assessed mineralization, proliferation, and gene expression (SPP1, RUNX2) in human osteoblasts, and antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. All functionalized membranes improved osteoblast activity, with adsorption showing superior results. Antibacterial tests showed slight but significant reductions in bacterial colonies, especially for adsorption. Additional mechanical tests via unconfined compression were performed to evaluate the effect of functionalization on the membranes' mechanical properties. These tests confirmed that neither functionalization method compromised the stiffness of the membrane, a critical parameter in clinical applications. Overall, peptide adsorption is a simple and clinically adaptable strategy to enhance CollaTape®'s bioactivity and antibacterial properties while maintaining their original mechanical properties.&#xD.","","Ya","0.00","1748-605X","",""

This study evaluates the osteogenic effects of xHyA-functionalized native pericardium collagen membrane (NPCM) and ribose-crosslinked collagen membrane (RCCM) using an airlift culture model with SaOS-2 cells. Transcriptomic changes following xHyA treatment were also investigated. SaOS-2 cells were cultured on NPCM and RCCM, with or without xHyA functionalization. Cytocompatibility, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mineralization (Von Kossa staining), and RNA sequencing were assessed. Differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted on cells exposed to two xHyA concentrations. Both membrane types supported cell viability, though NPCM allowed cellular infiltration while RCCM maintained barrier integrity. xHyA significantly enhanced ALP activity and mineral deposition across both substrates. RNA sequencing revealed minimal upregulation of classical osteogenic genes but identified differential expression in pathways related to focal adhesion, VEGF signaling, and stem cell differentiation. IGF1R, FYN, and MAPK14 were consistently upregulated regardless of xHyA concentration. xHyA functionalization enhances osteogenic activity, evidenced by increased ALP and mineralization, likely via modulation of cell-matrix interactions rather than classical osteogenic gene activation. These findings support using xHyA-functionalized membranes in GBR and warrant further investigation in vivo.","","Parsial","0.00","2198-4034","11","1"
