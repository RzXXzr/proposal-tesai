To address these limitations, this study developed bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived exosome mimetics (EMs), produced through an optimized extrusion methodology, which enhanced production yield while preserving the core morphology and structure of natural exosomes with augmented functionality in key biological processes. Furthermore, these EMs are coated with a tannic acid (TA)/Fe3+ coordination network that acts as a protective barrier with antioxidative and antibacterial properties. This coating enables EMs to promote stem cell proliferation, migration, osteogenesis, and immunomodulation under inflammatory and oxidative stress conditions. In vivo, the local injection of EM@[TA-Fe3+] effectively suppressed periodontal inflammation and promoted alveolar bone regeneration. These findings advance our understanding of the structural and functional characteristics of EMs and present an efficient strategy for their delivery in bone regeneration especially under inflammatory and/or infectious conditions.","","Ya","0.00","1878-5905","327",""

This study introduces a novel one-step strategy for applying a polyphenol-aminoglycoside (PA) coating on various implant substrates, including titanium, in a simple and efficient manner. The multifunctional PA coating can reduce implant failure through its strong antibacterial, immunomodulatory, and osteoinductive activities. By eliminating bacterial infection, promoting the M2 macrophage phenotype, and restoring oxidative balance, PA-coated implants create a favorable osteoimmune microenvironment that supports the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, the PA-coated implants exhibit potent osseointegration in vivo. Collectively, these findings indicate that surface modification with a PA coating represents a promising strategy to meet the clinical requirements of next-generation dental and orthopedic implants in complex clinical environments.","","Ya","0.00","2192-2659","",""

Peptides, as short protein sequences that have defined functionalities, are highly stable and easy to synthesize and have enormous potential to reshape interfacial properties. However, the lack of a universal strategy for presenting peptides on various substrates substantially hinders the application of peptides. In this study, we report a facile and universal strategy for customizing desired interfacial functionalities by a well-known layer-by-layer (LbL) technique through the assembly polyphenols with positively charged short peptide-coupling functional sequences. Polyphenol-peptide interactions were elucidated in detail by assembling polyphenols and peptides possessing different characteristics (charged, uncharged, hydrophobic, and sequence length) in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, and isothermal titration calorimetry further revealed the favorable enthalpy change due to electrostatic interactions is the main driving force for assembling peptides with polyphenols. LbL coatings assembled from polyphenols and positively charged peptides exhibited good substrate generalization, stability, cell proliferation, and antioxidant properties, when prepared as hollow capsules by sacrificing the template, exhibited significant pH and ultrasound stimulation responses, which could be suitable candidates for drug carriers. Most importantly, the LbL assembly strategy of positively charged peptides could be utilized to present various functional molecules (such as arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid (RGD), a cell adhesion motif; CM15, an antibacterial peptide; and PEG, an antifouling surface) on various substrates for customizing desired surfaces. This study not only provides new insights into the understanding and regulation of interactions between proteins/peptides and polyphenols but also paves the way toward the interfacial functionalization of biomaterials.","","Parsial","0.00","1477-3155","23","1"

The initial stages of bone-related immunomodulation and cellular colonization play crucial roles, but have received limited attention. Herein, a novel supramolecular co-assembled coating of strontium (Sr)-doped metal polyphenol networks (MPN) modified with c(RGDfc) is developed and well-characterized, for eliciting an early immunomodulation and cellular colonization. The results showed that the (Sr-MPN)@RGD coating significantly regulated the polarization of macrophages to the M2 phenotype by controllable release of Sr, and promote the initial adhesion of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) by RGD presented on MPN. Notably, the (Sr-MPN)@RGD attenuated osteoclast differentiation and oxidative stress as well as enhanced osteoblast differentiation and angiogenesis due to macrophage polarization toward M2 phenotype, which in turn has a profound effect on neighboring cells through paracrine signaling. In vivo results showed that the (Sr-MPN)@RGD coating manifested superior osseointegration and bone maturation to the bare Ti-rod or Ti-rod coated with MPN and Sr-MPN.

Herein, a library of oligopeptides with rich diversity, numerous polyphenols, and modulators are explored to reveal their roles in the formation and regulation of SA coating. Citric acid (CA) is an effective regulator of interaction between the polyphenols and peptides to produce peptide-polyphenol coatings, TCP. The electrostatic interaction between tannic acid (TA) and cationic peptide drives the formation of TCP, while the multiple hydrogen bonds between CA and TA and peptide dominate the assembly kinetics. With optimized assembly pH and the mass ratio of TA, CA, and peptide, the thickness of TCP coating deposits onto diverse substrates (glass, silica, titanium, polystyrene) is ≈400 nm with controllable kinetics. The multifunctional TCP coatings are endowed via peptide-coupled functional units, including enhanced cellular adhesion, elevated osteogenic capacity, anti-protein adsorption, and antimicrobial.

Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) technology enables the formation of a biocompatible porous TiO2coating on Ti surfaces, offering advantages such as a simple fabrication process, strong adhesion to the substrate, and the ability to incorporate functional ions (e.g. Ag+, Cu2+, Sr2+). This modification significantly enhances cellular adhesion and osteogenic activity.

The most important of these effects include cardioprotective, neuroprotective, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, osteoinductive, and anti-microbial effects. Resveratrol has cis and trans isoforms, with the trans isoform being more stable and biologically active. Despite the results of in vitro experiments, resveratrol has limited potential for application in vivo due to its poor water solubility, sensitivity to oxygen, light, and heat, rapid metabolism, and therefore low bioavailability. The possible solution to overcome these limitations could be the synthesis of resveratrol in nanoparticle form. Accordingly, in this study, we have developed a simple, green solvent/non-solvent physicochemical method to synthesize stable, uniform, carrier-free resveratrol nanobelt-like particles (ResNPs) for applications in tissue engineering. UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) was used to identify the trans isoform of ResNPs which remained stable for at least 63 days. The additional qualitative analysis was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), while X-ray diffraction (XRD) determined the monoclinic structure of resveratrol with a significant difference in the intensity of diffraction peaks between commercial and nano-belt form. The morphology of ResNPs was evaluated by optical microscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) that revealed a uniform nanobelt-like structure with an individual thickness of less than 1 μm. Bioactivity was confirmed using Artemia salina in vivo toxicity assay, while 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazylhydrate (DPPH) reduction assay showed the good antioxidative potential of concentrations of 100 μg/ml and lower.

Electrospun fibrous scaffolds have attracted significant interest as effective barrier membranes for guided bone regeneration (GBR); however, no mature strategy yet exists for the surface modification of fibers to provide versatility to satisfy clinical requirements. This study demonstrated a practical biosafety strategy: the combined use of plant polyphenols and LL-37 peptides to modify the fiber surface to endow the fibrous scaffold with antimicrobial activity, immunoregulation, and vascularized bone regeneration. We confirmed that the LL-37 peptides interacted with tannic acid (TA) through noncovalent bonds through experiments and molecular docking simulation analysis. In vitro experiments showed that the TA coating imparted strong antibacterial properties to the fibrous scaffold, but it also caused cytotoxicity. The grafting of LL-37 peptide promoted the spreading, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and was also conducive to the M2 polarization of RAW264.7 cells. In vivo experiments further verified that the LL-37 peptide-grafted fibrous scaffold significantly enhanced angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory effects, and type-H vascularized bone regeneration. Overall, the fibrous scaffold modified by the LL-37 peptide through TA grafting has significant potential for GBR applications.","","Ya","0.00","1944-8252","15","6"

To address the plaguing issue, we devise a glucose-primed orthopedic implant composed of polyetheretherketone (PEEK), Cu-chelated metal-polyphenol network (hauberk coating) and glucose oxidase (GOx) for boosting diabetic osseointegration. Upon DIME, GOx on implants sostenuto consumes glucose to generate H2O2, and Cu liberated from hauberk coating catalyzes the H2O2 to highly germicidal •OH, which massacres pathogenic bacteria through photo-augmented chemodynamic therapy. Intriguingly, the catalytic efficiency of the coating gets greatly improved with the turnover number (TON) of 0.284 s-1. Moreover, the engineered implants exhibit satisfactory cytocompatibility and facilitate osteogenicity due to the presence of Cu and osteopromotive polydopamine coating. RNA-seq analysis reveals that the implants enable to combat infections and suppress pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1). Besides, in vivo evaluations utilizing infected diabetic rat bone defect models at week 4 and 8 authenticate that the engineered implants considerably elevate osseointegration through pathogen elimination, inflammation dampening and osteogenesis promotion. Altogether, our present study puts forward a conceptually new tactic that arms orthopedic implants with glucose-primed antibacterial and osteogenic capacities for intractable diabetic osseointegration.","","Ya","0.00","1878-5905","303",""

The minerals were homogeneously deposited on the surface of the scaffold using 0.01 M NaHCO3 with epigallocatechin gallate in simulated body fluid solution (M2). The M2 scaffold demonstrated enhanced mineral coating amount per scaffold with a greater compressive modulus than the others which used different concentration of NaHCO3. Then, we immobilized PDGF on the mineralized scaffold (M2/P), which enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose derived stem cells in vitro and promoted the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors. Cells cultured in M2/P showed remarkable ratio of osteocalcin- and osteopontin-positive nuclei, and M2/P-derived medium induced endothelial cells to form tubule structures. Finally, the implanted M2/P scaffolds onto mouse calvarial defects had regenerated bone in 80.8 ± 9.8% of the defect area with the arterioles were formed, after 8 weeks. In summary, our scaffold, which composed of minerals and pro-angiogenic growth factor, could be used therapeutically to improve the regeneration of bone with a highly vascularized structure. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Surface engineered scaffolds have been developed for bone regeneration but inducing the volumetric regeneration of bone with neovessels remains a challenge. In here, we developed 3D printed scaffolds with bioactive surfaces coated with bio-minerals and platelet-derived growth factors. We proved that the 0.01 M NaHCO3 with polyphenol in simulated body fluid solution enhanced the deposition of bio-minerals and even distribution on the surface of scaffold. The in vitro studies demonstrated that the attached cells on the bioactive surface showed the enhanced osteogenic differentiation and secretion of pro-angiogenic factors.

However, constructed scaffolds that simultaneously promote bone regeneration and in situ inhibit bacterial proliferation remains a great challenge. This study aimed to design a bone repair scaffold with in situ antibacterial functions. Herein, a general strategy is developed by using epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major green tea polyphenol, firmly anchored in the nano-hydroxyapatite (HA) and coating the 3D printed polymerization of caprolactone and lactide (PCLA) scaffold. Then, we evaluated the stability, mechanical properties, water absorption, biocompatibility, and in vitro antibacterial and osteocyte inductive ability of the scaffolds. The coated scaffold exhibit excellent activity in simultaneously stimulating osteogenic differentiation and in situ resisting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization in a bone repair environment without antibiotics. Meanwhile, the prepared 3D scaffold has certain mechanical properties (39.3 ± 3.2 MPa), and the applied coating provides the scaffold with remarkable cell adhesion and osteogenic conductivity. This study demonstrates that EGCG self-assembled HA coating on PCLA surface could effectively enhance the scaffold's water absorption, osteogenic induction, and antibacterial properties in situ. It provides a new strategy to construct superior performance 3D printed scaffold to promote bone tissue regeneration and combat postoperative infection in situ.","","Parsial","0.00","1365-2184","55","10"

When inserting Ti implants into jawbones, the main issue is the lack of strong bonding between the Ti implant and the host bone (osseointegration). Inspired by the outstanding adhesion performance of natural phenolic compounds on metal substrates and promoting effect for cell adhesion, we coated a natural plant extract, Dipterocarpus tuberculatus (MED), on Ti implants. We tested three groups of Ti plates and screw-shaped fixtures: nontreated Ti as commercially produced, ozone-treated Ti as commonly used surface modification for dental implants, and MED-coated Ti. Interestingly, the MED coating on the Ti plate preserved the surface wetting property for 20 days, whereas the hydrophilic wetting of ozone-treated Ti was readily transformed to hydrophobic within a day. Computerized tomography and histopathological analysis revealed that MED coating enhanced new bone tissue formation and regeneration. The gene expression level of integrin as a bone cell adhesion receptor and its downstream key regulators was significantly increased than that of ozone-treated Ti. Therefore, we suggest considering MED-mediated cell signaling pathways in screening natural products for cell adhesion and osseointegration, and MED as a suitable coating agent for improving Ti implantation.","","Ya","0.00","2373-9878","8","2"

The system developed here allows the combination of hydroxyapatite, chitosan, and polyphenol properties in the same multifunctional biomaterial in order to modulate the host response after implantation. Crosslinked chitosan is used in this research to create a stable coating on hydroxyapatite, and then it is functionalized for a smart release of the polyphenols. The release is higher in inflammatory conditions and lower in physiological conditions. The properties of the coated and functionalized samples are characterized on the as-prepared samples and after the samples are immersed (for 24 h) in solutions, which simulate the inflammatory and physiological conditions. Characterization is performed in order to confirm the presence of polyphenols grafted within the chitosan coating, the stability of grafting as a function of pH, the morphology of the coating and distribution of polyphenols on the surface, and the redox reactivity and radical scavenging activity of the functionalized coating. All the results are in line with previous results, which show a successful coating with chitosan and functionalization with polyphenols. Moreover, the polyphenols have a different release kinetics that is faster in a simulated inflammatory environment compared to that in the physiological environment. Even after the release tests, a fraction of polyphenols are still bound on the surface, maintaining the antioxidant and radical scavenging activity for a longer time. An electrostatic bond occurs between the negative-charged polar groups of polyphenols (carboxyls and/or phenols) and the positive amide groups of the chitosan coating, and the substitution of the crosslinker by the polyphenols occurs during the functionalization process.","","Ya","0.00","1520-5827","37","51"

We revealed that EGCG-coating on polycaprolactone (PCL) film surface increased hydrophilicity and anti-oxidative properties as a function of total phenol content (TPC) potentially due to the increase in phenolic -OH and π-electrons from structural maintenance and directly removed the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by resonance-stabilization. Furthermore, EGCG-coated PCL film increased attachment, spreading area, and viability of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) against H2O2 treatment while stimulated the cellular signaling to reduce apoptotic gene and enhance anti-oxidative enzyme expression. Further, we applied EGCG coating on the surface of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) fibers. Spheroids incorporating EGCG-coated PLLA fibers were able to maintain their shape and showed improved viability and anti-oxidative activities in response to H2O2-induced oxidative stress than control spheroids.
