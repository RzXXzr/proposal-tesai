Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) addresses these defects using barrier membranes that block soft tissue infiltration and promote bone growth. CollaTape®, a type I bovine collagen membrane, is widely used for its biocompatibility and resorbability, though its bioactivity and antibacterial properties could be improved. This study compares two functionalization methods for enhancing CollaTape® membranes: adsorption of GBMP1α peptide (a BMP-2 biomimetic) and covalent anchoring of its analogue Aoa-GBMP1α. Both functionalizations were performed at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/mL. Optimal conditions were selected basing on osteoblast mineralization assays and resulted to be 0.25 mg/mL for adsorption and 1.5 mg/mL for covalent binding. Peptide surface density analysis revealed values of 0.040 μmol/cm² for adsorption and 0.278 μmol/cm² for covalent anchoring. Biological assays assessed mineralization, proliferation, and gene expression (SPP1, RUNX2) in human osteoblasts, and antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. All functionalized membranes improved osteoblast activity, with adsorption showing superior results. Antibacterial tests showed slight but significant reductions in bacterial colonies, especially for adsorption. Additional mechanical tests via unconfined compression were performed to evaluate the effect of functionalization on the membranes' mechanical properties. These tests confirmed that neither functionalization method compromised the stiffness of the membrane, a critical parameter in clinical applications. Overall, peptide adsorption is a simple and clinically adaptable strategy to enhance CollaTape®'s bioactivity and antibacterial properties while maintaining their original mechanical properties.&#xD.","","Ya","0.00","1748-605X","",""

Autologous GBR capitalizes on the body's inherent regenerative capabilities in conjunction with strategic interventions, benefiting from enhanced biocompatibility and integration with osteogenic processes. This review delineates recent advancements in autologous GBR within the context of craniomaxillofacial surgery. First, it elucidates the fundamental concepts and mechanisms underlying autologous GBR, emphasizing the biological processes of osteogenesis along with various influential factors. Second, it explores material applications in autologous GBR-encompassing both absorbable and nonabsorbable barrier membranes as well as diverse types of bone graft substitutes-highlighting their distinct characteristics and clinical outcomes. Third, this review discusses the clinical applications of autologous GBR across subfields, such as dental implantation, jaw defect repair, and correction of craniofacial deformities through representative evidence-based cases. Fourth, it addresses challenges encountered by autologous GBR-including issues related to regeneration efficiency and complications such as infection or membrane exposure-and proposes optimization strategies to mitigate these concerns. Finally, this review investigates innovative research directions encompassing gene therapy combined with GBR technology as well as applications of 3D printing while forecasting future trends toward multitechnology integration and precision treatment approaches. This comprehensive review serves as an essential reference for clinicians and researchers engaged in craniomaxillofacial surgery and its associated disciplines.","","Ya","0.00","1536-3732","",""

This comprehensive review is an in-depth exploration of the evolution of Mg-based barrier membranes using a ""bedside-to-bench and back-again"" paradigm and highlights their clinical relevance and innovative material characteristics. Considering clinical demands, this study primarily assesses how ideal membranes meet the clinical principle of GBR, mainly focusing on their material properties that properly align with the clinical functionality of the ""PASS"" principles (primary wound closure, angiogenesis, space maintenance, and stability). Furthermore, current research findings demonstrate that Mg-based membranes exhibit characteristics that go beyond mere barrier function and provide an optimal balance between promoting bone regeneration and preventing bacterial infiltration during soft tissue healing. By this action, Mg-based membrane serves as a safeguard for inexperienced oral surgeons, increasing the likelihood of optimal clinical outcomes even in the event of complications such as wound dehiscence. Consequently, the use of Mg-based membranes could simplify the GBR and dental implant placement procedures, potentially reducing the failure rate of these clinical treatments. Concerning clinical applications, Mg-based membranes have recently expanded beyond GBR treatment, encompassing many clinical cases. This review underscores the need for continuous innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration to advance the clinical use of Mg-based membranes. The successful translation of Mg-based membranes from basic concept to clinical practice indicates the significant potential of Mg-based materials in regenerative medicine.","","Ya","0.00","1878-5905","328",""

Bioabsorbable collagen membranes, the gold standard in GBR procedures, are appealing due to elimination of the need for secondary surgeries and mechanical properties mimicking native tissue. However, challenges include rapid degradation, inconsistent reproducibility in mechanical and morphological properties, and use of animal-derived tissues. This study explored silk fibroin, a biocompatible and slowly bioabsorbable biomaterial as an alternative for GBR membranes. Silk fibroin showed comparable mechanical performance and demonstrated improved reproducibility. Two silk fibroin-based multilayered membranes (SF1 and SF2) were developed showing homogeneous appearance, density, and thickness, with lower variability than the other tested commercial options. These membranes exhibited elasto-plastic mechanical behaviour in both dry and hydrated states, supporting improved surgical handling and dimensional stability. Furthermore, elastic modulus in hydrated state (23.8 ± 3.2 MPa for SF1, 27.6 ± 3.9 MPa for SF2), burst pressure (17.5 ± 5.0 mmHg for SF1, 290.0 ± 32.6 mmHg for SF2), and force at first deformation in the suture retention strength test in hydrated state (0.10 ± 0.03 N for SF1, 0.26 ± 0.11 N for SF2) were comparable to commercial collagen membranes, suggesting the suitability for GBR applications.

The optimum pore size fulfilling the equilibrium between mechanical properties and biological behavior was explored for severe alveolar bone regeneration. Printing accuracy, surface structural characteristics, roughness, hydrophilicity, and mechanical properties of the PEEK membranes were evaluated. Finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted to analyze the stress and strain distribution in the guided bone regeneration (GBR) model. Cell morphology, viability, and osteogenic differentiation were carried out utilizing human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs) in vitro. The calvarial defect of rabbits in critical size was established, and new bone formation at 4 and 8 weeks after implantation was evaluated by micro-CT and histomorphometry. The results showed that the PEEK meshes, accompanied by one rough surface and another smooth side, exhibited great printing accuracy and hydrophobicity. The mechanical properties were inversely proportional to the pore diameter of the PEEK mesh, yet all groups had satisfactory stretchability. FEA indicated great stress dispersion, spatial retention, and mucosal integrity preservation in PEEK-300 and PEEK-500. In vitro tests showed that the macropores of PEEK-500 and PEEK-700 promoted greater hWJ-MSC migration and osteogenic differentiation.

Mg-NW-Ti was effectively synthesized through a series of chemical reactivity tests, and its morphology, roughness, hydrophilicity, elemental composition, and ion release were characterized.

Submicron-scale pure Zn exhibited a moderate degradation rate in simulated body fluids, and no deep corrosion pits appeared on the surface. By contrast, the degradation rate of nano-surface pure Zn decreased significantly, while localized corrosion tended to appear on micron surfaces. In addition, the degradation rate of Zn with different roughness was overall accelerated in artificial saliva, accompanied by varying degradation morphologies.

Peri-implant regeneration is a field that requires further optimization to increase predictability. The submerged approach has been shown to yield superior defect fill compared to the non-submerged approach. Nevertheless, primary closure in the submerged approach can result in diminished keratinized tissue. This case study presents an alternative approach to managing advanced peri-implantitis, with the use of open membrane technique. A 71-year-old female presented with #30 peri-implantitis, exhibiting 10 mm probing depth, suppuration upon probing, and severe bone loss. The implant prosthesis was removed prior to the surgery to gain access to instrumentation. Subsequent to the debridement of the defect and implant detoxification, a mix of xenograft and enamel matrix derivatives was used to fill the defect. High-density polytetrafluoroethylene membrane was placed over the defect. The flaps were replaced without attempting primary closure, and the membrane was intentionally left exposed. Disease resolution with significant radiographic bone fill was achieved and remained stable with 20 months follow-up. In addition, keratinized tissue was adequately preserved after surgery. Reconstructive surgery using the open membrane approach can be an alternative for managing advanced peri-implantitis defects, with the advantages of preserving keratinized tissue and reducing intrasurgical trauma. The open membrane technique may serve as a viable alternative to primary closure in guided bone regeneration for peri-implant reconstructive procedures. Advantages include reduced surgical trauma, shorter procedure time, and preservation of keratinized tissue. Careful case selection is essential for achieving predictable outcomes. Factors to consider include defect configuration, the number of remaining bony walls, and the size of the wound opening. In more challenging cases, combination therapy and the adjunctive use of biologics may be considered to enhance regenerative potential and improve clinical results. This case study presents the regenerative treatment of chronic inflammation and bone loss around a dental implant using the open membrane technique. To manage the condition, the crown portion of the dental implant was removed, and the implant surface was thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. The space around the implant was then filled with bone graft and biological agents and covered with a membrane. Unlike typical regenerative procedures, the membrane was intentionally left partially exposed rather than being fully covered by the gum during healing. After the procedure, the infection was resolved, and the area remained healthy for up to 20 months. This case suggests that the open membrane technique may be a successful option for treating severe implant infections, especially when the goal is to preserve protective gum tissue.","","Ya","0.00","2163-0097","15","4"

The authors describe a new technique for the reconstruction of intra-bony vertical defects caused by peri-implantitis, which requires the removal of the prosthetic superstructure to have better access to the surgical site, in order to perform the defect debridement and the implant surface decontamination and detoxification, before placing the reconstructive biomaterials. A 2 mm high cap screw was connected to the implant with the aim of not letting a cross-linked collagen membrane to collapse over the implant threads. This membrane covered the implant and the whole defect, filled with a porcine bone graft wet with hyaluronic acid. A second membrane, made of dense polytetrafluoroethylene (dPTFE), was placed over the previous one and left exposed, avoiding a second intervention for its removal, which occurred after a 5-week healing time by grasping the membrane with forceps and removing it with a gentle tug. After cap screw removal, it was possible to insert an healing abutment. The augmented bone remained stable 2.5 years after prosthetic superstructure re-insertion. Soft tissue architecture was maintained since the flaps were not repositioned coronally, the mucogingival line and the fornix were not distorted, and there was no reduction of keratinized mucosa. The benefits of this technique include the reliable defect isolation and containment of graft particles, ease of membrane placement, simplified dPTFE membrane removal, and preservation of mucogingival architecture. The prosthetic superstructure removal provides better access to the surgical site in order to perform the defect debridement and the implant surface decontamination and detoxification, before placing the reconstructive biomaterials. The use of a 2 mm high closure cap or a short healing abutment prevents membrane collapse on the implant threads. Since the dense polytetrafluoroethylene membrane is not buried, but intentionally left exposed, its removal after a 5-6-week healing period doesn't require a second surgery. Furthermore, it is also possible to re-insert the prosthetic superstructure, reducing the overall treatment time generally respected with the conventional submerged approach, which involves uncovering the implant after a healing period of 6-9 months. The authors describe a new technique for the reconstruction of intra-bony vertical defects caused by peri-implantitis, which requires the removal of the prosthetic superstructure to have better access to the surgical site, in order to perform the defect debridement and the implant surface decontamination and detoxification, before placing the reconstructive biomaterials. Two membranes are used: a collagen membrane that covers the whole defect filled with a xenograft, and a dense polytetrafluoroethylene membrane, applied over the collagen one, that is intentionally left exposed in order to easily remove it after a 5-6-week healing period without a second surgery.

In this study, we employed laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) to fabricate a porous WE43 magnesium alloy scaffold suitable for large alveolar bone defects. We then used electrospinning and layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly to create a silk fibroin-based barrier membrane loaded with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and polydopamine (PDA) for combined antibacterial and osteogenic functions.

Magnesium (Mg)-based metals have good prospects for use as biodegradable barrier materials due to their elastic modulus, good biocompatibility, and osteogenic properties. In this study, gallium (Ga) was introduced into Mg to enhance the mechanical strength and optimize the degradation behavior of the alloy, addressing the limitations of conventional magnesium alloys in corrosion control and strength retention. Methods: Mg-xGa alloys (x = 1.0-3.0%, wt.%) were evaluated for biocompatibility, degradation, and osteogenic potential. Corrosion rates were calculated via weight loss, Mg2+ release, and pH changes. Osteogenic effects were assessed using rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, extracellular matrix (ECM) mineralization, and osteogenic-related gene expression. Optimal alloy was fabricated into barrier membranes with different pore sizes (0.85-1.70 mm) for the rabbit mandibular defect to evaluate the porosity effect on new bone formation. Results: Cytocompatibility tests established a biosafety threshold for Ga content below 3 wt.%. Mg-1Ga demonstrated uniform corrosion with a rate of 1.02 mm/year over 28 days. In vitro, Mg-1Ga enhanced ALP activity, ECM mineralization, and osteogenic gene expression. The 1.70 mm pore size group exhibited superior new bone formation and bone mineral density at 4 and 8 weeks.

Methods: The mechanical properties of the polymer, together with the fabrication procedure, offer porosity with interconnectivity to permit cell adhesion and proliferation. Bacterial contamination of the BM can induce infection at the bone level, leading to unfavorable clinical outcomes of the regeneration procedure. Results: Therefore, BMs have been proposed as carriers for local GEN antibiotic therapy, demonstrating antibacterial properties against S. aureus, S. mutans, and P. aeruginosa, depending on the drug concentration, while being negligibly affected by the nHAP content. X-ray diffraction, FTIR-ATR, and SEM allowed for BM structural characterization, demonstrating the presence of GEN/nHAP and establishing the fiber diameter, which influences the mechanical properties in dry and wet conditions and the drug release behaviorA BM cytotoxicity assessment, performed over 1 and 5 days, revealed that a high nHAP concentration provided protection against cytotoxicity, in contrast to GEN, and that cell proliferation and cell adhesion increased in the presence of nHAP.

These membranes are sourced from various tissues, such as skin, pericardium, peritoneum, and tendons, which exhibit differences in regenerative outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the morphological and chemical properties of porcine collagen membranes from five different tissue sources: skin, pericardium, dermis, tendons, and peritoneum. (2) Methods: The membrane structure was analyzed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), variable pressure scanning electron microscopy (VP-SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermal stability via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The absorption capacity of the membranes for GBR was also assessed using an analytical digital balance. (3) Results: The membranes displayed distinct microstructural features. Skin- and tendon-derived membranes had rough surfaces with nanopores (1.44 ± 1.24 µm and 0.46 ± 0.1 µm, respectively), while pericardium- and dermis-derived membranes exhibited rough surfaces with macropores (78.90 ± 75.89 µm and 64.89 ± 13.15 µm, respectively). The peritoneum-derived membrane featured a rough surface of compact longitudinal fibers with irregular macropores (9.02 ± 3.70 µm). The thickness varied significantly among the membranes, showing differences in absorption capacity. The pericardium membrane exhibited the highest absorption, increasing by more than 10 times its initial mass. In contrast, the skin-derived membrane demonstrated the lowest absorption, increasing by less than 4 times its initial mass. Chemical analysis revealed that all membranes were primarily composed of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry analyses showed no significant compositional differences among the membranes. FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of collagen, with characteristic peaks corresponding to Amide A, B, I, II, and III.

Additionally, an evolving body of literature demonstrates that membrane fixation may lead to improved clinical bone gain through positively influencing blood clot formation, stability, and the eventual osteogenic potential of the defect. Alternative benefits to membrane fixation, such as reduced graft displacement and reduction in wound micromotion, have also been cited as mechanisms for an increased regenerative response. The aim of this report was to present a case, including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for the reconstruction of a horizontal ridge deficiency. The patient's deficiency in ridge volume was found to be a developmental sequelae of lateral incisor agenesis, resulting in an underdeveloped midfacial region of the alveolar process subjacent to sites #7 and #10. The fixation protocol outlined in this report demonstrated adequate horizontal ridge augmentation to facilitate future prosthetic reconstruction with the use of implants. Numerous protocols have been established in an attempt to achieve effective barrier membrane stabilization for bone augmentation procedures. However, some techniques are poorly suited for the anatomically challenging region of the anterior maxilla. A case report describing the utilization of the anterior nasal spine for anchorage of a membrane-stabilizing suture may present a novel, safe, and effective technique for stabilizing the intended region of augmentation, as well as preventing graft migration beyond the membrane-maxilla interface.

Histologically, the PM group had a lower area fraction of the mean value of newly formed bone than the TM group, yet the difference was not significant. The PM group had a higher mean osteocyte count than the TM group, but again, the difference was not significant. Guided bone regeneration using either pericardium membrane or titanium mesh is a reliable treatment for horizontal augmentation of insufficient maxillary alveolar ridge width. No significant differences between both treatment modalities were noticed clinically and histologically. However, percentage change in radiographic volumetric measurements using TM was significantly higher than that of PM.

The soft external layer comprised of Gt/PCL-simvastatin, the external layer of PCL and the middle layer of both microfilaments, interwoven together. The membrane was designed to promote osteoinduction and act as a barrier against cells but not against water and molecules in order to promote guided bone regeneration. The structure of the membrane was characterized by scanning electronic microscopy. The in vitro release rates of simvastatin over 32 days were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. For in vitro biological assays, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and human fibroblasts were cultured on the different surfaces of the membrane. Cell adhesion, proliferation, distribution, and differentiation were examined. For in vivo testing, cranial defects were created in rabbits to assess the amount of new bone formed for each membrane. The results revealed that membranes with multi-layered structures showed good cell viability and effective osteoinductive and barrier properties. These results suggest that the novel multi-layered PCL-Gt/PCL-simvastatin membranes have great potential for bone tissue engineering.","","Ya","0.00","1792-0981","22","1"

However, in a pediatric patient, if this defect is left untreated, it can cause further atrophy leading to collapse of the arch. In the maxillary anterior area, this is also of esthetic concern. Hence, it is viable to reconstruct the alveolar defects and restore the alveolar anatomy with superior quality of bone while the patient is still in growing phase to avoid any structural and dental malformation, as well as to provide a more novel treatment like dental implant at a later stage when growth ceases. Modes for successfully augmenting the bone are diverse. Among these, barrier membrane with guided bone regeneration, distraction osteogenesis, and bone block graft is ubiquitous. The current case report deals with the management of horizontal atrophic anterior maxillary region using autologous block bone graft harvested from mandibular symphysis, to augment the alveolar ridge and aid in esthetic and functional restoration of alveolar anatomy by restoring the defect with the bone of superior quality as well as preparing the site for receiving implant prosthesis in future when growth ceases.

We prepared a non-woven absorbable membrane for GBR comprised of a copolymer of L-lactic acid and glycolic acid (PLLGA) using the dry spinning method. A thin and dense membrane comprising unsintered hydroxyapatite (uHA) and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) was used for comparison. Osteoblast TMS-12 cells were seeded onto the membranes, and cell adhesion and proliferation rates were examined. Calcification levels were quantified by Alizarin Red S staining after cell culture in calcification induction medium. Osteoblastic gene expression was examined by RT-PCR. Cell adhesion and proliferation rates and calcification on PLLGA membranes were significantly higher than those on uHA/PLLA membranes. PLLGA membranes upregulated osteogenic gene expression compared to on uHA/PLLA membranes. Non-woven PLLGA membranes may be useful in GBR for promoting bone formation and maturation.","","Ya","0.00","1881-1361","40","5"

First, the morphology of APP (BonanGenⓇ) was detected using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Next, for biocompatibility test, proliferation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) were determined using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) after being seeded 1, 3 and 7 days. Meanwhile, the cells stained with phalloidine and 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were observed using a confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to view the morphology of cell adhesion and pattern of cell proliferation on day 5. A 3-Beagle dog model with 18 teeth extraction sockets was used for the further research in vivo. These sites were randomly treated by 3 patterns below: filled with Bio-OssⓇand coverd by APP membrane (APP group), filled with Bio-OssⓇand covered by Bio-GideⓇmembrane (BG group) and natural healing (blank group). Micro-CT and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) were performed after 4 and 12 weeks. A bilayer and three-dimensional porous ultrastructure was identified for APP through SEM. In vitro, APP facilitated proliferation and adhesion of hBMSCs, especially after 7 days (P < 0.05). In vivo, for the analysis of the whole socket healing, no distinct difference of new bone ratio was found between all the three groups after 4 weeks (P>0.05), however significantly more new bone regeneration was detected in APP group and BG group in comparison to blank group after 12 weeks (P < 0.05). The radio of bone formation below the membrane was significantly higher in APP group and BG group than blank group after 4 and 12 weeks (P < 0.05), however, the difference between APP group and BG group was merely significant in 12 weeks (P < 0.05). Besides, less resorption of buccal crest after 4 weeks and 12 weeks was observed in APP group of a significant difference compared in blank group (P < 0.05). The resorption in BG group was slightly lower than blank group (P>0.05). APP showed considerable biocompatibility and three-dimentional structure. Performing well as a barrier membrane in the dog alveolar ridge preservation model, APP significantly promoted bone regeneration below it and reduced buccal crest resorption. On the basis of this study, APP is a potential osteoconductive and osteoinductive biomaterial.","","Ya","0.00","1671-167X","53","4"

The defects were reconstructed with particulate autologous bone and covered with a microperforated titanium membrane (Ti-honeycomb membrane, TiHM) or an existing conventional titanium mesh as control. The samples were dissected after 16 weeks postoperatively and processed for radiographic, histologic, and histomorphometric analyses. Regenerated tissue and bone volume were significantly larger in the TiHM group than in the control group (p = 0.05; p = 0.049). In contrast, bone mineral density was similar between the two groups. Histomorphometric analysis revealed that the regenerated bone area and calcific osseous area were larger in the TiHM group than in the control group; however, the differences were not significant. The efficacy of TiHM was generally satisfactory with the potential to become a standard tool for the GBR procedure; however, early membrane exposure will be a major problem to overcome.","","Ya","0.00","1996-1944","14","12"

The primary aim of this review was to evaluate the incidence and types of complications that occur after horizontal GBR and propose management strategies to deal with these clinical situations. A secondary aim was to conduct a histomorphometric review of the wound healing process at sites that experienced post-surgical complications after GBR. A keyword search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies published in English from January 2015 to January 2020 was conducted for the primary aim and 23 studies were selected. A second search addressing the secondary aim was conducted, and five studies were included. Site-level analysis showed that the weighted mean incidence proportion of minor wound dehiscence and minor infections occurring at the augmented site was 9.9% [95% CI 6.4, 13.9, P < 0.01] and 1.5% [95% CI 0.4, 3.1, P = 0.21) respectively. Patient-level analysis showed minor and major complications occurring at a weighted mean incidence proportion of 16.1% [95% CI 11.9, 20.8, P = 0.01] and 1.6% [95% CI 0.0, 4.7, P < 0.01] respectively, while neurosensory alterations at the donor site was 7.0% [95% CI 1.3, 15.5, P < 0.01]. Subgroup analysis also revealed that the use of block grafts increased the incidence proportion of minor post-surgical complications, whereas a staged GBR procedure increased the incidence proportion of both minor and major post-surgical complications. Although exposure of the barrier membrane is often associated with less bone regeneration and graft resorption, the type of membrane used (resorbable or non-resorbable) had no statistically significant influence on any post-surgical complication. Histologically, a layer of fibrous connective tissue instead of bone is commonly observed at the interface between the native bone at the recipient site and the regenerated bone in cases with membrane exposure after GBR procedure. Minor wound dehiscence was the highest incidence proportion of post-surgical complications. Methods ranging from daily application of antiseptics, use of systemic antimicrobials, regular reviews, and total removal of the non-integrated biomaterials are commonly prescribed to manage these post-surgical complications in attempt to minimise the loss of tissue at the surgical site.","","Ya","0.00","2198-4034","6","1"

Our group has previously reported the construction of a barrier membrane made of ammoniomethacrylate copolymer USP (AMCA), which supports the adhesion, proliferation, and osteoblastic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). In this study, we report the use of AMCA membranes to seclude critical segmental defect (~1.0 cm) created in the middle third of rabbit radius and test the efficiency of bone regeneration. Bone regeneration was assessed by radiography, biweekly for 8 weeks. The results were verified by histology and micro-CT at the end of the follow-up. The AMCA membranes were found superior to no treatment in terms of new bone formation in the defect, bone volume, callus surface area normalized to total volume, and the number of bone trabeculae, after eight weeks. Additional factors were then assessed, and these included the addition of simvastatin to the membrane, coating the membrane with human MSC, and a combination of those. The addition of simvastatin to the membranes demonstrated a stronger effect at a similar radiological follow-up. We conclude that AMCA barrier membranes per se and simvastatin delivered in a controlled manner improve bone regeneration outcome.","","Ya","0.00","2314-6141","2020",""
