Its chemical composition and biological activity are highly influenced by the botanical and environmental conditions surrounding the beehives. In Colombia, limited studies have addressed the chemical diversity and therapeutic potential of propolis from regions with high altitudinal variation such as Tolima. In this study, three propolis ethanolic extracts (PrEE1, PrEE2, PrEE3) were obtained from hives located at different altitudes in Tolima, Colombia (1250, 1100, and 900 m above sea level (a.s.l.), respectively). Samples were analyzed for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidant capacity (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP), antimicrobial activity (disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration), and cytotoxicity in A549, WI-38 and NIH-3 T3 cell lines. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) analysis revealed a distinct phytochemical profile for each extract. PrEE1 had the highest TPC (130.2 g GAE kg-1) and TFC (6.70 g QE kg-1), and strong antioxidant activity with DPPH scavenging of 89.2%. It also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, and selective cytotoxicity toward A549 lung cancer cells. In contrast, PrEE3 had lower phenolic content but contained unique polyprenylated benzophenones. The results indicate that altitude significantly influences the chemical and biological properties of Colombian propolis. Propolis from higher altitudes, such as PrEE1, is a promising natural source of multifunctional bioactive compounds with antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer potential for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.","","Ya","0.00","1097-0010","106","2"

Rats treated with the green propolis extract exhibited of ulcer reduction more significant reduction after 24 hours of treatment than untreated animals, suggesting a similar healing activity of the commercial drug. After 96 hours of treatment, the rats were euthanized, and the corneas were submitted for histopathological analysis; no statistical difference was detected between rats treated with green propolis and those not treated in terms of polymorphonuclear and neovessel counts in the corneal stroma. In the toxicogenetic analysis, by the micronucleus test, no significant differences were observed in the frequencies of chromosomal damage and the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes to the total number of erythrocytes between treated and untreated animals, revealing the absence of genotoxicity and cytotoxicity, respectively. The biochemical results did not indicate a hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic effect of the formulations containing green propolis.

It induces apoptosis in various cancer cells, making it a highly promising natural medicine. Although the health benefits and food applications of TGP are widely recognised, no study has explored its effects on Taiwan oral cancer cells (OECM1). This study investigated whether TGP induces apoptosis in OECM1 cells. Methods: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin-layer chromatography, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry were used to identify the components in TGP and the fruit peel of Macaranga tanarius. The inhibitory activities of TGP dissolved in DMSO (TGPDMSO) and encapsulated in food-grade zein nanoparticles (TGPNP) against OECM1 cells were compared using MTT assays. The morphological changes, cell cycle analysis, and protein expression profiles of OECM1 cells after the TGP treatments were performed using microscopy, flow cytometry, and Western blot, respectively. Results: An MTT assay of TGPDMSO-treated OECM1 cells suggested an IC50 of 12.6 µg/mL, demonstrating that TGPDMSO exhibits significant cytotoxicity. Subsequent MTT assays revealed TGPNP's cytotoxicity against OECM1 with an IC50 of 11.6 µg/mL. Flow cytometry revealed that TGPNP induced a cell arrest in S phase and DNA fragmentation. Western blotting analyses manifested an increase in Bax and cl-Casp9 and a decrease in Bcl2 and PARP. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that both TGPDMSO and TGPNP treatments induced apoptosis in OECM1 cells with a comparable IC50. Notably, utilising edible zein as a nanoparticle carrier for TGP mitigates the cytotoxicity risk associated with DMSO, providing a novel and safe approach for cancer treatment.","","Ya","0.00","2227-9059","13","4"

Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola release lipopolysaccharide (LPS), constituting a virulence factor that takes part in the brain inflammatory process. Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1) are a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines released during periodontal diseases. Propolis is a rich source of quercetin and apigenin, which exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities, influencing the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Considering this aspect, models with stimulated HGF-1, followed by LPS and/or interferon-α (IFN-α), were used. Aim: This study was designed to evaluate the concentrations of selected cytokines produced by HGF-1, which may influence brain inflammation. The immunomodulatory effects of apigenin and quercetin were investigated by measuring the concentration of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-15 (IL-15), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α). This study's novelty is based on insights into the immunomodulatory effects of selected flavonoids by correlating the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by gingival fibroblasts during periodontal disease with inflammatory processes in the brain. The cytotoxicity of apigenin and quercetin was estimated using the MTT assay. Fibroblasts were stimulated with LPS at 200 ng/mL and/or IFN-α at 100 U/mL concentration, followed by incubation with apigenin (25-50 µg/mL) and quercetin (25-50 µg/mL). Cytokine concentrations were measured using the xMAP technology. Results: The most pronounced and statistically significant reduction in cytokine levels, particularly IL-6 and IL-15, was observed for quercetin in both concentrations (25 µg/mL and 50 µg/mL), especially following LPS stimulation. Apigenin in both analysed concentrations also significantly decreased the level of IL-6. These results suggest that quercetin and apigenin may indirectly act as potential immunomodulators in preventing brain inflammation by inhibiting the inflammatory process in periodontitis; however, this should be confirmed in further studies.","","Ya","0.00","1424-8247","18","5"

Both the effect on a multispecies dental biofilm precultured for 3.5 days as well as the inhibition of de-novo biofilm formation up to 24 h were investigated. Test substances at concentrations of 20%, 10% and 5% were applied to preformed biofilm for 1 min. The reduction in colony-forming units (cfu), metabolic activity, and biofilm mass were determined. Similarly, the test substances were applied to surfaces for 30 min before bacteria and media were added. The reduction of a tetrazolium dye (MTT assay) was used to assess cytotoxicity on gingival fibroblasts. The MIC values of all toothpaste formulations including TP con were very low with the highest MIC of 0.04%. In precultured biofilms, both the number of colony forming units (cfu) and metabolic activity decreased following addition of any toothpaste. The greatest reductions of cfu were found after addition of 20% TP com (by about 6 log10) and after 20% Manuka prop (by about 2.3 log10). However, the biofilm mass was not reduced. Coating the surface with toothpaste formulation, the cfu in the newly formed biofilm decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, with TP com being most active. Both 20% of Manuka prop and Manuka F reduced the cfu counts more than the TP con at 24 h. The toothpaste formulations affected the viability of gingival fibroblasts in a concentration-dependent manner, with no differences observed among the formulations. The Manuka-honey containing toothpastes might be an alternative to toothpaste containing conventional chemical agents.

The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of PROP and RJ against E. intestinalis. The phenolic composition of PROP was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection, and the chemical components of RJ were evaluated according to ISO12824 standards. The cytotoxicity of PROP and RJ on HEK-293 cells was evaluated using the XTT assay. The three highest non-cytotoxic concentrations of each sample were tested for their effects on E. intestinalis spores by qRT-PCR. Trichrome-stained photomicrographs were used to assess spore density in HEK-293 cells treated with PROP and RJ. PROP analysis revealed flavonoids such as quercetin, kaempferol, pinocembrin and galangin, as well as phenolic acids such as caffeic and cinnamic acids, known for their bioactive properties. RJ contained mainly proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and sugars, reflecting its role as a nutritionally and biologically active substance. According to the results of this first study evaluating the effect of PROP and RJ on E. intestinalis, all concentrations evaluated in the study showed a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of E. intestinalis spores compared to the control group.

Additionally, it can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, demonstrating neuroprotective effects. The aim of the present study was to determine the concentration of selected cytokines produced by astrocytes of the CCF-STTG1 cell line, isolated from the brain of a patient with stage IV glioma (astrocytoma). Methods: The cytotoxicity of the EEP-B was evaluated using the MTT assay.

Propolis is a well-known waxy resin recognized for its antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and cytotoxic effects. In this study, we aimed to clarify the formation mechanism of propolis nanoparticles from the perspective of their stability and chemical composition. By evaluating the light absorption behaviour of the nanoparticles formed in different media and quantifying the polyphenols, we show that they are superficially hydrophobic nanoparticles with the capacity to encapsulate some polar compounds. Biological activity was evaluated by in vitro cell viability performed on NIH/3T3 fibroblasts incubated with 10, 100, and 1000 μg/mL of propolis nanoparticles for 48 hours. The results show that nanoparticles are cytocompatible, with a proliferation effect. In contrast, the results of the viability of metastatic murine B16F10 cells indicate that a dose with a concentration of 5 μg/mL in the cell culture media is sufficient to stop the abnormal cell growth, having an antitumor effect. This effect might be related to the flavonoids present in the propolis nanoparticles. In vivo dermal irritability tests on New Zealand rabbits show that propolis nanoparticles' aqueous dissolution was non-irritant. According to the results obtained from this study, reducing the size of raw propolis down to nanoparticles and dispersing them in water solvents enhance its positive effects. The superficially hydrophobic propolis nanoparticles encapsulate active compounds such as polyphenols and flavonoids, which also confirms their ability to generate selective effects on the cells, depending on their nature.","","Ya","0.00","1875-5992","25","17"

Firstly, planktonic bacterial growth was assessed through optical density measurements and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. Subsequently, a 4-species or clinical ex vivo multispecies biofilm was used to evaluate antibiofilm effects through selective agar plating and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or live-dead biofilm imaging, respectively. Lastly, cytocompatibility to oral rinses was tested using a 3D human fibroblast spheroid model. SL significantly inhibited the growth of disease-associated F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis 12 and 120 h, respectively, after treatment, while exhibiting lower toxicity toward commensal S. oralis, S. gordonii, and V. parvula vs. LIS or CHX (all p < 0.05). Correspondingly, in 4-species biofilms, selective agar plating and FISH-staining showed decreased abundance of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis after 4 h recovery following SL treatment vs. PBS control while maintaining a robust commensal biofilm of S. oralis and V. parvula. In contrast, CHX or LIS treatment demonstrated non-selective killing, leading to sparse biofilms with residual F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. When tested against clinical ex vivo multispecies biofilms, all oral rinses showed significant antibiofilm effects (all p < 0.001), disrupting biofilm structure and reducing bacterial viability. Lastly, 3D human fibroblast spheroids treated with CHX or LIS displayed greater cytotoxicity with detachment of cellular debris from the spheroid mass, while spheroids exposed to SL exhibited minimal cell death with cellular viability maintained across the spheroid structure. The SL homeopathic rinse demonstrated selective action on oral bacteria, preferentially reducing pathogen bacterial load while preserving commensal species with high cytocompatibility.

This study aimed to develop macroporous bone scaffolds composed of a chitosan/agarose matrix reinforced with nanohydroxyapatite and enriched with stable CAPE derivatives to enhance their biomedical potential for applications in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. A comprehensive evaluation of microstructural and biological properties of the produced scaffolds was conducted. The fabricated scaffolds exhibited high porosity (49-60%) with interconnected pores and compressive strength (1.2-1.8 MPa), closely resembling cancellous bone and indicating suitability for bone regeneration. They were biocompatible, promoted osteoblast adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, and supported apatite deposition on their surfaces, demonstrating strong bioactivity and potential for implant osseointegration. Importantly, the scaffolds did not trigger excessive production of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, suggesting a low risk of inflammatory responses. Additionally, CAPE-enriched scaffolds inhibited biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, reducing the risk of implant-associated infections. In summary, these CAPE-modified scaffolds integrate optimal microstructural and biological features, such as reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting biofilm formation, and thus offer a promising strategy for enhancing bone repair and regeneration in clinical applications.","","Ya","0.00","1996-1944","18","22"

Extracellular vesicles mediate intercellular communication and influence immune responses. Chrysin, a natural flavone found in fruits and propolis, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects. This study explored the immunomodulatory potential of chrysin-loaded EVs (EVs-Chry) derived from BV2 microglial cells. BV2 cells were treated with chrysin for 24 h to assess cytotoxicity and proliferation. EVs were isolated from treated and untreated cells, characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, and applied to naïve BV2 cells prior to LPS stimulation. Effects on cell morphology, migration, cytokine expression (IL-1β, IL-6), inflammasome activity (caspase-1), and apoptosis-related protein Bcl-xL were investigated. Our results show that EVs-Chry significantly reduced LPS-induced cell proliferation, restored resting microglial morphology, and reduced migratory capacity. Furthermore, co-treatment with EVs-Chry and LPS reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and caspase-1 expression while enhancing anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL levels, indicating a shift toward an anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective micro-glial phenotype. Together, our results demonstrated that EVs-Chry have neuroprotective effects on LPS-induced microglial activation and modulate microglial responses to inflammatory stimuli, attenuating pro-inflammatory signaling and promoting cellular homeostasis. These findings support the therapeutic potential of EVs-Chry in the context of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders.","","Ya","0.00","1420-3049","30","15"

Thus, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are particularly suitable for enhanced antibacterial and anticancer therapy. In this research, we report the green synthesis of β-cyclodextrin-functionalized cellulose nanocrystals (β-CD/CNCs) from pistachio shells as a carrier material for propolis, as well as the determination of its antibacterial and anticancer properties. The β-CD/CNCs were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). FTIR analyses indicated the successful attachment of β-cyclodextrin to the cellulose nanocrystals. FE-SEM and TEM images of β-CD/CNCs exhibited rod-shaped morphology, while the XRD pattern revealed the crystal structure of β-CD/CNCs. The chemical composition of the propolis extract was investigated using GC-MS analysis. The incorporation of the propolis extract into the β-CD/CNCs was achieved with 10% encapsulation using the differential weighing method. Subsequently, the antibacterial and anticancer properties of the propolis-loaded β-CD/CNCs were determined. The antibacterial activity was assessed using the disk diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer method) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination by the dilution method (DM). The anticancer properties were evaluated using MTT and flow cytometry assays on two liver cell lines (HepG2 and L929). The results demonstrated that the propolis loaded in β-CD/CNCs exhibited better antibacterial and anticancer activity than free propolis. Therefore, β-CD/CNCs can be suggested as a suitable carrier for propolis.","","Ya","0.00","2045-2322","15","1"

While its antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties are well known, the anticancer properties of propolis are just beginning to be appreciated. Herein, we comparatively investigate the cytotoxic and radiosensitizing potential of four different ethanolic propolis extracts originating from three different countries (Germany, Ireland, South Africa) in human lung cancer cell models. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was applied to characterize the four different propolis extracts. Cytotoxicity and radiation survival were determined by 3D matrix-based clonogenic assays and autophagy was examined by western blotting. We found cytotoxicity in a propolis type-, time- and cell model- dependent manner. In the four ethanolic propolis extracts, Coumaric acid, Caffeic acid phenethyl ester, Pinocembrin and Chrysin presented the major compounds identified. Examining the induction of autophagy using the marker LC3B and autophagy inhibition with chloroquine suggested autophagy to be part of the survival mechanisms upon propolis treatment in a cell model-dependent manner. Combining propolis with X-ray irradiation showed the radiosensitizing potential of propolis in human lung cancer cell models, which clearly presented in a manner dependent on the incubation time of propolis and the cell model treated. Propolis treatment showed cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effects of propolis on human lung cancer cells.
