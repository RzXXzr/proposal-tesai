Forty-three patients (43 implants) diagnosed with peri-implantitis underwent surgical treatment using a reconstructive approach, which included a bone substitute material with (test) or without (control) a resorbable collagen membrane. Supportive peri-implant treatment was administered biannually during the 3-year follow-up period. Clinical outcomes, such as probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP), suppuration on probing (SOP), marginal mucosal level (REC) and keratinised mucosa width (KM), were recorded at baseline, as well as at 6, 12 and 36 months. Radiographic marginal bone levels (MBLs) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were also evaluated. The primary outcome was a composite measure consisting of PPD ≤ 5 mm, absence of BOP/SOP and buccal REC of ≤ 1 mm. A second composite outcome, termed 'disease resolution', was also assessed, defined as PPD ≤ 5 mm, BOP at ≤ 1 site and complete absence of SOP. Out of the 43 participants, 8 were lost to follow-up, 2 experienced implant loss and 1 was surgically re-treated. At 3 years, the composite outcome was achieved for 25.0% of implants (test: 17.6%; control: 27.8%), while disease resolution was achieved for 31.2% (test: 29.4%; control: 27.8%). Overall, PPD and BOP were reduced by 3.6 ± 3.2 mm and 37.5% ± 42.1%, respectively. Changes in buccal REC and KM were 0.5 ± 1.3 and 1.1 ± 1.5 mm, respectively. An overall bone gain (MBL change) of 1.0 ± 2.2 mm was observed. PROs were favourable. No statistically significant differences were observed between groups. Adding a collagen membrane to a bone substitute material in the surgical treatment of peri-implantitis did not yield any benefits regarding clinical, radiographic or patient-reported outcomes.

Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) addresses these defects using barrier membranes that block soft tissue infiltration and promote bone growth. CollaTape®, a type I bovine collagen membrane, is widely used for its biocompatibility and resorbability, though its bioactivity and antibacterial properties could be improved. This study compares two functionalization methods for enhancing CollaTape® membranes: adsorption of GBMP1α peptide (a BMP-2 biomimetic) and covalent anchoring of its analogue Aoa-GBMP1α. Both functionalizations were performed at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/mL. Optimal conditions were selected basing on osteoblast mineralization assays and resulted to be 0.25 mg/mL for adsorption and 1.5 mg/mL for covalent binding. Peptide surface density analysis revealed values of 0.040 μmol/cm² for adsorption and 0.278 μmol/cm² for covalent anchoring. Biological assays assessed mineralization, proliferation, and gene expression (SPP1, RUNX2) in human osteoblasts, and antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. All functionalized membranes improved osteoblast activity, with adsorption showing superior results. Antibacterial tests showed slight but significant reductions in bacterial colonies, especially for adsorption. Additional mechanical tests via unconfined compression were performed to evaluate the effect of functionalization on the membranes' mechanical properties. These tests confirmed that neither functionalization method compromised the stiffness of the membrane, a critical parameter in clinical applications. Overall, peptide adsorption is a simple and clinically adaptable strategy to enhance CollaTape®'s bioactivity and antibacterial properties while maintaining their original mechanical properties.&#xD.","","Ya","0.00","1748-605X","",""

Berberine (BBR) has been reported to inhibit fibrosis and promote bone regeneration, yet it remains unclear whether BBR can simultaneously suppress fibroblast activity while enhancing osteogenic differentiation. This study aims to identify the optimal BBR concentration and its dual mechanisms in inhibiting fibroblast proliferation while promoting osteogenic differentiation, potentially providing an alternative to the barrier function of traditional GBR membranes. The optimal BBR concentration and its effects on fibroblast proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were evaluated in vitro. Network pharmacology and proteomics were used to investigate the potential mechanisms. A rat model of alveolar bone defects was used to evaluate the reparative effect of BBR. Seahorse analysis, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence were employed to explore BBR's regulatory effect on mitochondrial function in both cell types. BBR at 10 and 15 μM optimally promotes osteoblast dominance within the wound healing microenvironment, induces G1-phase arrest in fibroblasts, and promotes osteogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, BBR directly binds to prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2) and upregulates Ptgs2 to achieve the dual effects. In vivo, the bone regeneration effect of the BBR and Bio-Oss® (a commercial bone substitute) combination was similar to that of the Bio-Oss® and Bio-Gide® combination (a commercial collagen membrane). Furthermore, distinct COX-2 localization patterns were observed following BBR treatment, with enhanced mitochondrial localization in osteoblasts and nuclear localization in fibroblasts, coupled with altered mitochondrial energy metabolism. Our study suggests that optimal concentrations of BBR can inhibit fibroblast proliferation and promote osteogenic differentiation, thereby enhancing bone regeneration. Combined with spatial maintenance materials, BBR presents a promising alternative to traditional GBR membranes for improving clinical outcomes in oral bone augmentation and defect repair.","","Ya","0.00","1618-095X","150",""

The study treatments were: control group (implant + no membrane); BG-group (implant + Bio-Gide membrane); and SG-group (implant + Striate + membrane). Six dogs were sacrificed at 4-, 8- and, 12-weeks post-treatment for radiographic (µCT) assessment, histological examination and histomorphometric analysis. µCT assessment showed that all groups exhibited increased bone formation from 4-weeks to 12-weeks post-treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in mean BV/TV between all 3 groups at weeks 4 and 8. At week 12, BV/TV was significantly higher in SG and BG-groups compared to control group. Assessment of bone microarchitectural parameters showed that animals in SG-group exhibited significantly higher Tb.N, O.Wi and lower Tb.Sp, suggesting more favorable mature bone structure. A significant increase in the number of osteoblasts on bone surface was also seen in SG-group. Histological assessment showed that SG-group displayed early signs of bone-to-implant contact at 8 weeks. While control sites showed early ingrowth of epithelium and connective tissue into the defects, infiltration of inflammatory cells, incomplete bone formation and limited bone to implant contact, use of a barrier membrane resulted in significant bone infill, mature bone formation with good bone to implant contact. and limited soft tissue invasion. This study demonstrated superiority of Striate + collagen membrane to promote good bone formation and prevent unwanted epithelial infiltration in a canine mode of GBR.","","Ya","0.00","1472-6831","25","1"

During surgery, the failing implant was removed using minimally traumatic techniques, and a new tissue-level implant was immediately placed, achieving a primary stability torque of 27 Ncm. The circumferential bone defect was treated with deproteinized bovine bone mineral combined with hyaluronic acid and covered with a resorbable collagen membrane to initiate bone reconstruction. The implant site was submerged, and healing was uneventful. Three months post- surgery, the implant was uncovered, and a screw-retained monolithic zirconia crown was placed, restoring masticatory function and esthetics.

A 19-year-old patient who lost his anterior teeth in an accident was treated with a horizontal osteotomy performed 4 mm from the alveolar ridge, with two oblique cuts made using an ultrasonic instrument, and the final phase of the osteotomy was performed with a lever for dental extraction. One mini-block of equine bone was inserted between the coronal osteotomized segment and the mandibular basal bone, with cancellous equine bone particles filling the residual space. A resorbable collagen membrane was used to cover the biomaterials and mini-block. Seven days after the augmentation procedure, there were no signs of dehiscence, lesions, infection, or segment movement. Four months after surgery, a CBCT radiograph was obtained for implant placement, revealing a 5-7 mm vertical increase without bone resorption or height loss. The radiographic assessment showed a mineralized zone between basal bone and coronal portion of osteotomized segments, whereas the histological analysis showed new bone and osteoid matrix around and inside the block material. As a result, this case report indicated that using an equine collagenated block in alveolar bone augmentation resulted in high stability while eliminating the need for mini-screws and mini-plates, resulting in a simplified sandwich technique.","","Ya","0.00","2050-0904","13","4"

Six weeks after initial surgery, identical procedures were performed on the contralateral area. Healing outcomes were assessed at 6 and 12 weeks through radiographic and histomorphometric analyses. The primary outcome was the length of the root surface covered by new cementum assessed histologically and the secondary outcome included other histomorphometric and radiographic healing outcomes. Radiographically, the GTR/SCPT groups showed significantly greater new bone volume than the control group at both 6- and 12-week timepoints (p < 0.05). Histologically, specimens treated with both formulations of SCPT displayed better-organized periodontal ligaments and improved cementum formation, similar to those treated with EMD. The group with the highest concentration of SCPT (GTR/SCPT4) exhibited the greatest amount of new cementum formation. Within the limitations of this study, both formulations of SCPT demonstrated significant regenerative potential in periodontal tissues, with outcomes comparable to those of EMD treatment, suggesting SCPT's viability as an alternative bioactive agent for periodontal regeneration in class II furcation defects.

The defect was subsequently filled by an osteoconductive bone substitute (GLYCOBONE), then covered either by a new natural polysaccharide membrane supplemented with hydroxyapatite, or by a commercial collagen membrane (BIO-GIDE). Results showed little spontaneous tissue regeneration for empty defects (bone volume fractions (BVF) below 40% after 12 weeks). The smallest size defect (2.8 mm) was the most reproducible and was thus selected for testing GBR membranes. Defects filled with GLYCOBONE and covered with membranes displayed for both materials accelerated and substantial bone regeneration (with BVF that reached 80% after 12 weeks).

This study utilized rhesus monkey models to compare the effectiveness of two techniques (pouch and non-pouch methods) in repairing large perforations, with a focus on their impact on bone regeneration. In five male rhesus monkeys, both sides of the sinus membrane were elevated and perforated. Each sinus was assigned to one of two groups: (a) the collagen membrane covered the perforated sinus membrane and all sinus walls formed a pouch (pouch Group); (b) the collagen membrane covered the perforated sinus membrane (non-pouch Group). Both sinuses were grafted with the same amount of deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM). Follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans were performed at 1 and 9 months, and all monkeys were euthanized at 9 months for micro-CT and histomorphometric analysis. The quantitative analysis of CT images showed no significant differences in the augmented height, density, and volume of grafted bone between the two groups at 1-month and 9-month follow-up. Similarly, the morphometric and histomorphometric analyses showed no significant differences. However, a notable discrepancy in bone modeling was observed between the two time points (Pgraft-resorption = 0.0227) along with a significant difference in the sphericity of new bone (Psphericity = 0.0446). The pouch technique may lead to more stable outcomes compared to the non-pouch technique, which has been documented as a promising approach to mitigate graft volume loss and enhance graft stability and aggregation. Besides, no significant difference was seen between pouch and non-pouch techniques in promoting bone regeneration for repairing perforations of the maxillary sinus membrane. This study explored two surgical techniques for repairing large perforations in the sinus membrane during dental procedures, focusing on the bone growth outcome. We compared the ""Loma Linda Pouch"" technique, which uses absorbable membrane to create a pouch that surrounds the inner surface of the sinus, to a traditional method. We measured various outcomes, including bone height, density, and overall volume, at 1 month and 9 months after surgery. Both techniques showed substantial and ideal bone growth, but the pouch method may help stabilize the bone graft and minimize graft volume loss in the long run. Importantly, both methods led to effective healing without major complications, and our findings showed that the absorbable membrane does not hinder new bone formation. These insights can assist dental professionals in selecting the most effective approach for sinus surgeries, ultimately improving the success of dental implants and enhancing patient outcomes.","","Ya","0.00","1943-3670","96","9"

Methods: C-CMC collagen membranes were prepared by lyophilization. The mineral composition and content were tested through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The micromorphology was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). Physical and mechanical properties, including the swelling rate, porosity, hydrophilicity, tensile strength, Young's modulus, degradation, and barrier function, were also evaluated. Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were cultured in vitro to observe their behavior. An in vivo critical-size rat calvarial defect model was used to validate the effects of the membrane on bone regeneration. Results: The C-CMC collagen membrane was successfully synthesized as a collagen-hydroxyapatite complex with intrafibrillar mineralization, exhibiting improved mechanical properties and an optimal swelling rate, porosity, hydrophilicity, and degradation rate.

Beta-tricalcium phosphate calcium sulfate (β-TCP/CS) is a novel material with self-hardening and tissue growth inhibition properties and can potentially replace the need for a membrane. This study compares β-tricalcium phosphate/calcium sulfate with deproteinized bovine bone mineral and a collagen membrane (DBBM/CM) to repair bone defects at implant sites over 6 months. Sixteen implant defects were divided into β-TCP/CS (n = 8) and DBBM/CM (n = 8). The results showed no significant differences in vertical and horizontal defect fill in millimeters between β-TCP/CS (2.87 ± 1.25 and 2.37 ± 1.06 mm, respectively) and DBBM/CM (3.5 ± 0.92 and 2.87 ± 1.12 mm, respectively). Buccal bone thickness (BT) alterations at the implant platform levels (BT0) were similar for both materials. However, β-TCP/CS exhibited greater bone alteration at the 2-mm level (BT2: -1.85 mm vs -0.47 mm) and 4-mm level (BT4: -1.79 mm vs 0.12 mm) apical to the implant platform compared to DBBM/CM. When assessing volume alteration, β-TCP/CS showed a significantly greater reduction at the platform to the 2 mm level (-61.98% vs -23.76%) than DBBM/CM. In conclusion, β-TCP/CS demonstrated promise for treating buccal bone defects around implants but exhibited higher graft reduction. This suggests that while β-tricalcium phosphate/calcium sulfate may offer clinical benefits, its potential for greater graft reduction should be considered. Further research and evaluation are warranted to fully understand the long-term implications of using β-TCP/CS in guided bone regeneration procedures.","","Ya","0.00","1548-1336","51","1"

BCM extracted within 20 or 40 min, which corresponds to a typical implant surgical procedure, and BCM extracted within 24 h, which corresponds to BCM released from the autologous bone chips in situ, contained significant and comparable amounts of TGF-β1, IGF-1, FGF-2, VEGF-A, and IL-11. Significant (p < 0.001) quantities of BMP-2 were only detected in the 24-h BCM preparation. The bioactive substances contained in the BCM were adsorbed to the nbCMs with almost 100% efficiency. A fast but sequential release of all investigated proteins occurred within 6-72 h, reflecting their stepwise involvement in the natural regeneration process. BCM-coated nbCM significantly (p < 0.05) increased the migratory, adhesive, and proliferative capacity of primary human bone-derived cells (hBC), primary human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLC), and an osteosarcoma-derived osteoblastic cell line (MG-63) compared to cells cultured on BCM-free nbCM. The high proliferative rates of MG-63 cells cultured on BCM-free nbCM were not further potentiated by BCM, indicating that BCM-coated nbCM has no detrimental effects on cancer cell growth. BCM-coated nbCM caused significant (p < 0.05) induction of early osteogenic marker gene expression and alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting an important role of BCM-functionalized nbCM in the initiation of osteogenesis. The 24-h BCM loaded on the nbCM was the only BCM preparation that caused significant induction of late osteogenic marker gene expression.

The respective mean reduction for group N-RES amounted to 0.1 ± 0.4 mm (p = 0.581). When comparing the buccal bone changes between both group over time, group RES exhibited greater reduction in comparison to group N-RES (intergroup p = 0.017). Profilometric analyses showed a non-significant trend towards soft tissue gain in group RES 0.6 ± 0.7 mm (p = 0.125). Conversely, N-RES group revealed stability, with a mean change of 0.0 ± 0.3 mm (p = 1.000). GBR using non-resorbable membranes seems to provide greater dimensional stability of augmented bone at 6 months re-entry and before implant loading compared to resorbable membranes. The lack of differences in the profilometric outcomes and contour changes may be explained by a partial compensation through an increase in soft tissue thickness with resorbable membranes. GBR using non-resorbable membranes may offer greater dimensional stability of augmented bone compared to resorbable membranes. However, these potential benefits may be offset by a compensatory increase in soft tissue thickness when using resorbable membranes.","","Ya","0.00","1436-3771","29","5"

The defects were grafted with or without the two bone grafts and covered by a collagen membrane. Dental implants were placed 24 weeks post grafting. Bone regeneration and osseointegration were evaluated using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), as well as histological and histomorphometric analyses, while implant stability was measured using resonance frequency analysis (RFA). Micro-CT revealed that both grafts significantly increased bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume (BV), total volume (TV), and BV/TV at 8 and 16 weeks. Twenty-four weeks after implant placement, comparable BMD, BV/TV, and bone-to-implant contact values indicated effective osseointegration. Histological analysis revealed new bone formation and integration between grafts. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated the preservation of bone height and angle. RFA indicated good implant stability in both groups. The two collagenated xenogenic bone grafts exhibited similar osteogenic potential and osseointegration in an artificial bone defect and implant model.

The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to determine the effectiveness and safety of an early loading strategy for patients who have undergone dental implant placement and GBR surgery for a missing maxillary anterior tooth and to clarify the effects of SIS membranes. Thirty-six study participants were randomly assigned into 3 groups: the GBR with a resorbable non-crosslinked porcine collagen membrane (Bio-Gide) and delayed implant loading (Gide-DL) group, the GBR with a resorbable non-crosslinked porcine collagen membrane (Bio-Gide) and early implant loading (Gide-EL) group, and the GBR with an SIS membrane and early implant loading (SIS-EL) group. The degree of implant torque was ≥35 Ncm. Definitive restorations were completed 6 months after surgery in the Gide-DL group and 6 weeks after surgery in the Gide-EL and SIS-EL groups. Clinical examination, intraoral scanning, radiograph examination, and white and pink esthetic scoring was performed at the 1-year follow-up to evaluate the implant survival rate, peri-implant conditions, soft tissue contour changes, marginal bone resorption, and esthetics. Data with a normal distribution and homogeneous variance were analyzed via 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the least significant difference (LSD) multiple comparison test. Data without a normal distribution or homogeneous variance were analyzed via the Kruskal-Wallis H test and Bonferroni multiple comparison test (α=.05 for all tests). No implant failures or significant differences in the probing depth, plaque index, or bleeding index among the 3 groups were detected at the 1-year follow-up. There was no significant difference in the soft tissue contour change among the 3 groups. Only the changes at 1 mm apical to the crown-gingival connecting margin in the SIS-EL group were significantly lower than those in the Gide-EL and Gide-DL groups (P<.05). The marginal bone levels and white and pink esthetic scores were not significantly different among the 3 groups (P>.05). The early loading strategy is suitable for patients who have undergone dental implant placement and GBR for a missing maxillary anterior tooth with good primary stability, and favorable clinical effects can be achieved with the use of SIS membranes.","","Ya","0.00","1097-6841","",""

The samples were harvested 4 weeks post-surgically and examined by micro-CT and histomorphometric analysis. New bone formation was evident in all defects. The mineralized tissue volume was significantly higher in the four tested biomaterials than in the NC group, but lower compared to the PC group. Histomorphometry showed similar levels of bone formation in all groups, whereas only the PC group reached a significantly higher total augmentation area than that of the NC. The PC group showed significantly higher mineralized tissue density and residual material area compared to the B3/G2 group, and more residual DBBM than the four tested biomaterials. New bone formation was not significantly affected either by different DBBM:α-TCP compositional ratios nor the presence of various gelatin carriers. Similar levels of osteoconductivity indicates the presumptive use of combined products in alveolar ridge augmentation to support bone formation.

Efforts to reduce the production of hard-to-recycle waste are becoming increasingly important to manufacturers, not only of consumer goods but also of specialized items that are difficult to manufacture, such as medical supplies, which have now become a priority for the European Union. The purpose of the study is to manufacture a novel human-purified type I collagen membrane from bone remnants typically discarded during the processing of cortico-cancellous bones in tissue banks and to evaluate its mechanical properties and effectiveness in regenerating bone-critical mandibular defects in rabbits. To prepare the novel membrane, cortico-cancellous bone chip samples from a local tissue bank were processed to isolate collagen by demineralization under agitation in HCl, cast into a silicone mold, and air-dried at room temperature and UV irradiation. The average thickness of the four batches analyzed by SEM was 37.3 μm. The average value of Young's modulus and tensile strength obtained from the specimens was 2.56 GPa and 65.43 Mpa, respectively. The membrane's efficacy was tested by creating a critical bicortical and bilateral osteoperiosteal defect in rabbit mandibles. The right-side defects were covered with the collagen membrane, while the left-side defects were left untreated as a control. Nine weeks post-surgery, clinical, radiological, and histological analyses demonstrated new bone formation in the treated areas, whereas the control sites showed no bone regeneration. This innovative approach not only contributes to sustainability in healthcare by optimizing biological waste but also exemplifies efficient resource use in line with the circular economy, offering a cost-effective, biocompatible option that could benefit national health systems.","","Ya","0.00","2218-273X","15","1"

In this study, we present a multifunctional collagen membrane reinforced with micro-magnesium wires coated with metal-phenolic networks (Col-MMW), designed for guided bone regeneration (GBR). The embedded magnesium wires provide mechanical reinforcement, enhancing the membrane's structural integrity and space-maintaining capability during early healing. Concurrently, magnesium degradation enables sustained, site-specific release of H2 and magnesium ions (Mg2+), offering a synergistic strategy to modulate the osteoimmune environment. Col-MMW attenuates intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reprograms cellular metabolism from glycolysis toward oxidative phosphorylation, thereby activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2)-mediated redox balance pathway and suppressing nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway-driven inflammation. This osteoimmunometabolic reprogramming leads to a significant reduction in inflammatory responses. In vivo studies, including rat subcutaneous implantation and calvarial defect models, demonstrated that the immunoregulatory effects of Col-MMW significantly promoted osteogenesis. By integrating mechanical reinforcement with localized metabolic and immune modulation, Col-MMW redefines the design paradigm of GBR membranes. These findings highlight Col-MMW as a next-generation biomaterial that combines structural integrity with targeted osteoimmunomodulation, addressing the unmet need for intelligent biomaterials for bone repair.","","Ya","0.00","1878-5905","329",""

Such collagen constructs are widely used as barrier membranes in guided tissue and bone regeneration, where controlled degradation is essential for maintaining function. Although conventional crosslinking methods extend stability, they may introduce cytotoxicity, alter mechanical behavior, or hinder tissue integration. This study evaluated whether incorporating L-serine, a polar amino acid capable of hydrogen bonding, could modulate collagen structure and slow degradation without chemical crosslinking. L-Serine was selected because its hydroxyl-containing side chain can engage in biocompatible, hydrogen-bond-mediated interactions that offer a mild, non-crosslinking means of stabilizing collagen. Collagen scaffolds, prepared by incorporating L-serine into a collagen hydrogel followed by drying, were produced with 0-40 wt% L-serine and characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and scanning electron microscopy. In vivo degradation was assessed in a subcutaneous mouse model comparing unmodified collagen, collagen containing 40 wt% L-serine, and a commercially available bilayer porcine collagen membrane (Bio-Gide®, composed of type I and III collagen), with residual area quantified by serial sonography and histological evaluation. Low-to-moderate L-serine incorporation preserved triple-helical features, while 40 wt% led to crystalline domain formation and β-sheet enrichment. L-serine-treated collagen exhibited significantly greater residual area (2.70 ± 1.45 mm2) than unmodified collagen (0.37 ± 0.22 mm2, p < 0.05), although Bio-Gide® remained the most persistent (5.64 ± 2.76 mm2). These findings demonstrate that L-serine incorporation can modulate collagen structure and degradation kinetics through a simple, aqueous, and non-crosslinking approach. The results provide preliminary feasibility data supporting amino acid-assisted tuning of collagen resorption properties and justify further evaluation using membrane-specific fabrication and application-relevant testing.","","Ya","0.00","2079-4983","16","12"

The purpose of this flap is to optimize soft tissue healing and esthetics in these situations, permitting primary closure without buccal flap advancement. Initially, after creating the surgical access with a sulcular and a mesial releasing incision, extraction of the fractured tooth and immediate implant placement were performed. A xenograft and collagen membrane were then placed. Subsequently, a tunnel pedicled connective tissue flap was created on the palate and rotated to the buccal, covering the collagen membrane. This approach avoided the need for an additional distal releasing incision, which may compromise a source of blood supply, thereby decreasing tissue nutrition and potentially resulting in loss of vestibular depth. The tunnel allowed for positioning the pedicled connective graft submucosally, maintaining access to the blood supply via the base. The healing of the soft tissues was uneventful with adequate vascularization and rapid epithelialization. After 3 months, reentry was performed using a circular scalpel, and an implant-supported provisional prosthesis was delivered. After 30 days of tissue conditioning, a ceramic crown was placed over the osseointegrated implant, resulting in a satisfactory esthetic outcome. The new flap design, called the tunneled pedicled connective tissue flap, proved effective for alveolar soft tissue sealing, providing adequate nutrition in guided bone regeneration procedures for compromised sockets. Prospective clinical studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to understand better the potential use of this new flap design for alveolar socket sealing and alveolar ridge preservation procedures on a routine basis.","","Ya","0.00","1548-1336","51","6"

Soft tissue healing was favourable, with no adverse reactions. Dimensional analysis revealed minimal changes in alveolar ridge width and height, indicating effective preservation of volume. This clinical study confirms that TiO2 scaffolds are a safe and effective option for promoting bone regrowth and preserving volume in human alveolar bone, thereby facilitating bone formation and maintaining ridge dimensions post-extraction.

A 6-month randomized clinical trial was conducted with 20 participants requiring ARP after tooth extraction. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1, which received BG alone, and Group 2, which received BG + MEM. Both groups were allowed to heal by secondary intention.

The collagenated bone graft alone yielded comparable outcomes to its combination with a collagen membrane in areas with thick buccal bone, simplifying the treatment process by reducing costs, time, and the need for additional materials. This study compared two methods for socket preservation after tooth extraction: one with a bone graft plug alone, and the other with the bone graft plug plus a collagen membrane. Twenty study participants were followed for 6 months after treatment. The hard and soft tissue changes were assessed by clinical, radiographic, ultrasound, and biopsy analyses. Both treatments demonstrated positive results, including stable ridge height and width, new bone formation, and healthy soft tissue healing. The results showed that using only the plug was just as effective as using the plug with the membrane in promoting bone regeneration. This simple approach reduces the need for additional materials, saving time and costs while achieving similar outcomes.","","Ya","0.00","1943-3670","",""

Until now, the only predictable way was the use of titanium-reinforced dense polytetrafluoroethylene (TR-dPTFE) membranes stabilized with self-drilling screws, which require large flaps for both placement and removal. This case report introduces a technique that does not require any membrane lingual fixation. A tenting screw was placed in the middle of an anterior mandibular defect. A small TR-dPTFE membrane was bent 90° to take an L shape and be positioned crestally and lingually to the defect. Then, a larger collagen membrane (CM) was sutured with absorbable stitches to its more lingual and apical part. The TR-dPTFE membrane was stabilized on top of the tenting screw with its cap screw. A mixture of autogenous and porcine bone in a 1:1 ratio filled the defect. Then, the CM was moved toward the buccal side and stabilized with pins. After 8 months, the site was re-opened, the TR-dPTFE membrane and the tenting screw were removed with a small lingual envelope flap, two implants were inserted in the augmented bone and healing abutments applied. A screw-retained bridge was delivered 6 weeks after implant insertion and the 2.5-year follow-up showed perfectly maintained hard and soft tissues. The stabilization of both membranes to the tenting screw reduced morbidity at re-entry avoiding a large lingual flap, while CM allowed graft revascularization from the periosteum, and resulted in optimal quality of the regenerated bone. Titanium-reinforced dense polytetrafluoroethylene (TR-dPTFE) membranes require stabilization with pins or screws at the recipient site and large flaps for both placement and removal. On the lingual side of the anterior mandible the use of miniscrews is difficult and invasive, while the use of a tenting screw, placed vertically in the middle of the defect, allows for a simple and easy membrane stabilization and removal. Two membranes are utilized: a small TR-dPTFE membrane, that is stabilized to the tenting screw with its cap screw, and that does not allow to a collagen membrane (CM), that is sutured to the TR-PTFE membrane to cover the exposed part of the defect, to collapse over the bone deficiency. The CM, that covers the majority of the defect, after its biodegradation, allows graft revascularization from the periosteum, and results in optimal quality of the regenerated bone. Vertical bone defects of the jaws require bone augmentation procedures to allow the correct implants insertion to rehabilitate the masticatory function and aesthetics of patients. Among these techniques, guided bone regeneration is one of the most widely used. This technique is based on the use of non-absorbable titanium-reinforced dense polytetrafluoroethylene (TR-dPTFE) barrier membranes whose titanium frame allows them to be given a shape and not collapse onto the underlying bone defect. Since these membranes require screw stabilization to the recipient bone, large flaps must be performed to place and remove them. A technique is proposed that simplifies the positioning of the TR-dPTFE membrane, with the application of a tenting screw positioned in the center of the bone defect to which the membrane is stabilized. This procedure eliminates the need to place screws on the lingual side and the execution of a large lingual flap for its removal at the time of surgical re-entry. Furthermore, a re-absorbable collagen membrane is sutured to the TR-dPTFE membrane, the extension of which is limited to the crestal and lingual part, to cover the buccal part and the entire defect, improving the maturation of the bone graft inserted below the two membranes.","","Ya","0.00","2163-0097","",""

In this case, surgically facilitated orthodontic treatment (SFOT) was proposed to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement while modifying the periodontal phenotype. An orthodontic patient was referred for periodontal evaluation of lower anterior teeth, which presented a thin gingival phenotype and bone dehiscence. SFOT was performed on the mandible using particulate allograft combined with platelet rich fibrin (PRF) and collagen membrane to augment soft and hard tissue, thereby preventing future recessions, while accelerating the treatment times. Six-month and 3-year follow-ups confirmed radiographic bone fill, absence of gingival recession and thick band of keratinized gingiva. SFOT also resulted in a shorter treatment time where desired tooth movements were achieved within 6 months with periodontal stability. SFOT provided clinical benefits by accelerating orthodontic movement, improving periodontal phenotype, preventing the displacement of teeth beyond the alveolar housing and minimizing the risk for development of dehiscences and gingival recessions. Orthodontic movements can create recessions and dehiscence in thin periodontal phenotypes. SFOT can help prevent bone dehiscence and creates a thicker gingival phenotype while accelerating treatment time. Adults who face lengthy orthodontic treatments and have thin gums have risks of gum problems. Surgically facilitated orthodontic treatment (SFOT) can help by speeding up tooth movements and improving gum health and thickness. A patient with thin gums and lack of bone in the lower front teeth was evaluated. The SFOT procedure involved using a bone graft, healing factors, and a collagen membrane to strengthen the gums and bones. This approach aimed to prevent future gum problems and speed up orthodontic treatment. Follow-ups at 6 months and 3 years after treatment showed good healing of the gums and bones, with no signs of gum recession and healthier, thicker gums. The desired tooth movements were achieved within 6 months, resulting in a shorter treatment time. The patient's gums remained stable throughout this period. SFOT offered significant clinical benefits, including faster tooth movement and improved gum health. It also helped prevent teeth from moving out of place and minimized the risk of gum recession and bone issues.

The scaffold we used is a nonparticulate osteoconductive bone substitute for repairing defects without migration of particles and maintaining volume above the walls and confines of the periodontal treatment site. This may provide a more predictable option for rebuilding lost supporting bone, especially in less contained defects. A case of periodontitis stage III grade A at tooth no. 5 treated with intentional defect overfill to sustain interdental papilla with filling of the defect. Established guided tissue regeneration techniques were used. After 15 days, complete soft tissue closure at the defect site and root coverage at tooth 6 due to coronal advancement of the flap were observed. After 1 year, the papilla between teeth 6 and 5 filled the interproximal space, recession at 6 and 5 was 0 mm, and clinical attachment level gain at 5 was 4 mm. Soft-tissue maturation continued over 2 years, showing increasing thickness and healthy aspect. Over 24 months, increasingly defined bone-like imagery of the infrabony defect was obtained on X-ray without probing. Using a cross-linked, completely resorbable collagen scaffold covered with a membrane based on the same engineering promoted tissue growth above the walls of the defect. This was effective in bone regeneration of an intrabony defect. Why is this case new information? This is a case report describing the use of a completely resorbable ossifying collagen sponge with intentional overfill of the periodontal defect. This surgical technique allowed the clinician to improve the reduced interdental papilla architecture together with filling of the defect.

Proper diagnosis and treatment planning Adequate and minimally invasive nonsurgical preoperative preparation of the soft tissues Graft trimming and proper adaptation Soft tissue management with mucogingival approach (split thickness papilla incision-flap elevation-sutures) What are the primary limitations to success in this case? Inadequate preoperative nonsurgical therapy Poor handling of soft tissue Inadequate graft shaping Strict adherence to pre- and postoperative oral hygiene and maintenance PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Bone or bone substitutes can be used to rebuild lost supporting bone in dental repairs. A female patient at risk of tooth loss because of gum infection and with a gap between two of her teeth was surgically treated with an ossifying collagen sponge (OSSIX Bone, Dentsply Sirona/Regenerative Solutions, Charlotte, NC, USA), covered by an ossifying collagen membrane (OSSIX Plus, Dentsply Sirona/Regenerative Solutions, Charlotte, NC, USA). This ossifying collagen sponge can be shaped as needed. This allowed the clinician to intentionally overfill during the procedure to treat the patient. Surgery was successful, with the patient's condition and defects repaired. She did not experience infection, pain, swelling, or discomfort as a result of the treatment. This is a novel use of this ossifying collagen sponge substitute. More studies may confirm the suitability of the bone substitute used in this case more generally in similar dental repair procedures.","","Ya","0.00","2163-0097","",""

A 60-year-old patient presented with horizontal ridge deficiency at site #30 and an endodontically treated tooth #31 with recurrent decay. A treatment plan was proposed to extract tooth #31 and utilize a dentin graft from the tooth for ridge augmentation at site #30. Following the atraumatic extraction of tooth #31, it was sectioned into a 1 mm thick dentin plate, sterilized, and processed to obtain a demineralized dentin graft. Following a mid-crestal incision and full-thickness flap elevation, the dentin plate was adapted on the buccal defect of site #30 with 10 mm fixation screws, and the gap between the plate and the buccal bone was filled with 0.5 cc of 50/50 cortico-cancellous bone allograft hydrated with saline, covered with collagen membrane followed by primary closure. At 6 months, a postoperative cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was obtained to evaluate the ridge width revealing sufficient ridge width for optimal implant placement. The radio-opaque dentin plate was visible on the CBCT depicting integration with the alveolar ridge. Following surgical implant preparation protocol, a 4 mm diameter and 8.5 mm length implant was placed in a restoratively driven position. This case reports favorable outcomes for GBR using a partially demineralized dentin plate as an alternative to an autogenous bone block graft for horizontal ridge augmentation for future implant placement. This case introduces a novel method utilizing partially demineralized dentin plates derived from extracted teeth for guided bone regeneration, showcasing its potential efficacy in addressing ridge deficiencies. Success, in this case, relies on meticulous sectioning of the tooth and processing of the dentin graft, precise adaptation and fixation of the graft to the residual ridge, and achieving primary closure for undisturbed healing. Limitations to success include the availability of teeth for extraction coinciding with the need for ridge augmentation and unstable graft fixation.","","Ya","0.00","2163-0097","15","1"

The authors describe a new technique for the reconstruction of intra-bony vertical defects caused by peri-implantitis, which requires the removal of the prosthetic superstructure to have better access to the surgical site, in order to perform the defect debridement and the implant surface decontamination and detoxification, before placing the reconstructive biomaterials. A 2 mm high cap screw was connected to the implant with the aim of not letting a cross-linked collagen membrane to collapse over the implant threads. This membrane covered the implant and the whole defect, filled with a porcine bone graft wet with hyaluronic acid. A second membrane, made of dense polytetrafluoroethylene (dPTFE), was placed over the previous one and left exposed, avoiding a second intervention for its removal, which occurred after a 5-week healing time by grasping the membrane with forceps and removing it with a gentle tug. After cap screw removal, it was possible to insert an healing abutment. The augmented bone remained stable 2.5 years after prosthetic superstructure re-insertion. Soft tissue architecture was maintained since the flaps were not repositioned coronally, the mucogingival line and the fornix were not distorted, and there was no reduction of keratinized mucosa. The benefits of this technique include the reliable defect isolation and containment of graft particles, ease of membrane placement, simplified dPTFE membrane removal, and preservation of mucogingival architecture. The prosthetic superstructure removal provides better access to the surgical site in order to perform the defect debridement and the implant surface decontamination and detoxification, before placing the reconstructive biomaterials. The use of a 2 mm high closure cap or a short healing abutment prevents membrane collapse on the implant threads. Since the dense polytetrafluoroethylene membrane is not buried, but intentionally left exposed, its removal after a 5-6-week healing period doesn't require a second surgery. Furthermore, it is also possible to re-insert the prosthetic superstructure, reducing the overall treatment time generally respected with the conventional submerged approach, which involves uncovering the implant after a healing period of 6-9 months. The authors describe a new technique for the reconstruction of intra-bony vertical defects caused by peri-implantitis, which requires the removal of the prosthetic superstructure to have better access to the surgical site, in order to perform the defect debridement and the implant surface decontamination and detoxification, before placing the reconstructive biomaterials. Two membranes are used: a collagen membrane that covers the whole defect filled with a xenograft, and a dense polytetrafluoroethylene membrane, applied over the collagen one, that is intentionally left exposed in order to easily remove it after a 5-6-week healing period without a second surgery.

Following flap elevation and conditioning of the recipient site, they were randomly allocated to the dPTFE membrane group or the collagen membrane group. All patients were treated with a 1:1 mixture of autogenous bone and DBBM. Nine months following bone augmentation, re-entry was performed, intra-surgical clinical measurements were registered, and core biopsies were obtained for histological analyses. Thirty-six patients were randomized (dPTFE membrane group: 8 females, 10 males, mean age 39; collagen membrane group: 14 females, 4 males, mean age 51) and all but one underwent re-entry. GBR was effective in both groups (p < 0.001) yet followed a different pattern over time (p = 0.010) with a higher postoperative alveolar width in the collagen membrane group followed by more graft resorption. At re-entry, the estimated marginal mean alveolar width was 7.0 mm in the dPTFE membrane group and 6.5 mm in the collagen membrane group at re-entry, without statistically significant differences between the groups (p = 0.326). However, infection occurred in 6/18 patients treated with a dPTFE membrane group versus in none treated with a collagen membrane. Clinical assessment at re-entry identified fibrous tissue at the buccal aspect in 7/18 (39%) patients treated with a dPTFE membrane and in 8/17 (47%) patients treated with a collagen membrane, without statistically significant differences between the groups (p = 0.738). Histomorphometric analyses showed newly formed bone in both groups (> 30%) and a minimal amount of DBBM particles (~5%), mostly being in intimate contact with surrounding newly formed bone (~70%). The non-mineralized tissue fraction was 5% higher in the dPTFE membrane group (p = 0.020). There were no significant differences between the groups for other histological outcome measures. Alveolar width enabled implant installation at 9 months in both groups, yet dPTFE membrane was prone to infection.

Group A received open flap debridement with deproteinized DBBM xenograft and a bioresorbable collagen membrane, while group B received DBBM with A-PRF. Clinical parameters, including probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival recession, radiographic bone fill, and oral hygiene status, were assessed at baseline and 6 months postoperatively. At the 6-month follow-up after regenerative procedures, both treatment groups showed improvements in clinical parameters and radiographic bone gain. At 6 months, no significant difference in CAL gain was found between group A (3.5 ± 0.79 mm) and group B (3.66 ± 0.88 mm), with a mean difference of 0.16 ± 1.26 mm (p > 0.05). Additionally, the radiographic bone fill (%BF) in the DBBM + collagen membrane group was comparable to that in the DBBM + A-PRF membrane group, with no statistically significant difference. Within the limitations of this study, the combination of DBBM and a collagen membrane (group A) resulted in significantly more favorable clinical outcomes in terms of radiographic bone fill for infrabony defects as compared to group B. Both collagen and A-PRF membranes with DBBM significantly improved clinical and radiographic outcomes in treating infrabony defects.

During flap surgery, the cyst was removed intact, and the exposed implant's surface was debrided thoroughly by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) rinsing, glycine air polishing, and saline rinsing. To deal with the significant bone defect caused by the cyst, a bovine porous bone mineral injected platelet-rich fibrin (BPBM-i-PRF) complex was applied to fill the defect, following a resorbable collagen membrane to cover. Seven years after surgery, no cyst recurrence was observed, and bone regeneration in the bone graft area was stable. The implants functioned well without mobility.

The study aimed to fabricate and evaluate the physical, chemical, and biological performance of BPin vitro. The BP was fabricated through freeze-drying and layer-by-layer assembly, comprised of a base serving as a scaffold, a central portion for promoting bone regeneration, an upper buccal portion for maintaining alveolar socket dimension with a covering collagen membrane (Memb) on the top and upper buccal surface to prevent soft tissue infiltration. The BP as the experimental group and a pure collagen plug (CP) as the control group were investigated and compared. Radiograph, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy mapping confirmed that the four-part BP was successfully assembled and fabricated. Swelling rate analysis indicated that BP, CP, and Memb reached swelling equilibrium within 1 hour. BP exhibited a high remaining weight percentage in collagenase solution (68.81 ± 2.21% on day 90) and sustained calcium ion release, reaching the maximum 0.13 ± 0.04 mmol l-1on day 14. In biological assays, BP exhibited excellent cell proliferation (The OD value increased from 0.02 on day 1 to 0.23 on day 21.). The BP group exhibited higher alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin content than the CP group within 21 days. Memb and BP exhibited outstanding barrier function, as evidenced by Hematoxylin and eosin staining.

Three patients with significant horizontal defects were treated with pre-trimmed TFs to create needed space, and then a 50/50 mixture of autograft and bovine xenograft was placed and covered with a collagen membrane. After 8 months of healing, the sites were reopened, and the titanium screws were removed with the frame. An average of 8.0 ± 1.0 mm of horizontal and 3.0 ± 0.0 mm of vertical bone gain were achieved at the time of reentry and implant placement surgery.

Bilateral calvaria defects with a diameter of 5 mm were prepared and covered with prototypes of collagen membranes (P1 or P2). The P1 membrane (positive control) presented a lower onset temperature of protein denaturation and a higher solubility than the P2 membrane (test). The contralateral defects were left uncovered (NC). After 1 and 4 weeks, the animals were euthanized. A microcomputed tomography analysis of the harvested samples was performed within and above the bony defect. Undecalcified ground sections were subjected to light microscopy and morphometric analysis. Bone formation was observed starting from the circumferential borders of the defects in all groups at 1-week of healing. The foci of ossification were observed at the periosteal and dura mater sites, with signs of collagen membrane mineralization. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. At 4 weeks, remnants of the collagen fibers were embedded in the newly formed bone. In the P2 group, significantly more bone volume, more new bone, and marrow spaces compared to the NC group were observed. Furthermore, the P2 group showed more bone volume ectocranially then the P1 group. Bone formation subjacent to a P2 membrane was superior than subjacent to the P1 membrane and significantly better compared to the control.

Alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) is a commonly utilized technique and a variety of bone substitute materials and biologics are applied in different combinations. For this purpose, a histological evaluation and the clinical necessity of subsequent guided bone regeneration (GBR) in delayed implantations were investigated in a prospective case series after ARP with a novel deproteinized bovine bone material (95%) in combination with a species-specific collagen (5%) (C-DBBM). Notably, block-form bone substitutes without porcine collagen are limited, and moreover, the availability of histological data on this material remains limited. Ten patients, each scheduled for tooth extraction and desiring future implantation, were included in this study. Following tooth extraction, ARP was performed using a block form of C-DBBM in conjunction with a double-folded bovine cross-linked collagen membrane (xCM). This membrane was openly exposed to the oral cavity and secured using a crisscross suture. After a healing period ranging from 130 to 319 days, guided trephine drilling was performed for implant insertion utilizing static computer-aided implant surgery (s-CAIS). Cores harvested from the area previously treated with ARP were histologically processed and examined. Guided bone regeneration (GBR) was not necessary for any of the implantations. Histological examination revealed the development of a lattice of cancellous bone trabeculae through appositional membranous osteogenesis at various stages surrounding C-DBBM granules as well as larger spongy or compact ossicles with minimal remnants. The clinical follow-up period ranged from 2.5 to 4.5 years, during which no biological or technical complications occurred. Within the limitations of this prospective case series, it can be concluded that ARP using this novel C-DBBM in combination with a bovine xCM could be a treatment option to avoid the need for subsequent GBR in delayed implantations with the opportunity of a bovine species-specific biomaterial chain.","","Ya","0.00","2306-5354","11","7"

We present here the design and fabrication of a bifunctional Janus GBR membrane based on a shear flow-driven layer by a layer self-assembly approach. The Janus GBR membrane comprises a calcium phosphate-collagen/polyethylene glycol (CaP@COL/PEG) layer and a chitosan/poly(acrylic acid) (CHI/PAA) layer on different sides of a collagen membrane to form a sandwich structure. The membrane exhibits good mechanical stability and tailored biodegradability. It is found that the CaP@COL/PEG layer and CHI/PAA layer contribute to the osteogenic differentiation and antibacterial function, respectively. In comparison with the control group, the Janus GBR membrane displays a 2.52-time and 1.84-time enhancement in respective volume and density of newly generated bone. The greatly improved bone repair ability of the Janus GBR membrane is further confirmed through histological analysis, and it has great potential for practical applications in bone tissue engineering.","","Ya","0.00","2373-9878","10","6"

This study analyzed the possible interaction of an acellular collagen membrane of porcine origin (NM) with platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) regarding its rehydration protocol with differences in pH values and effect on angiogenesis. NM was analyzed alone and combined with solid PRF by plotting or co-culturing with injectable PRF. Different media (venous blood, buffer solution with a fixed pH value of 7, saline solution, and injectable PRF) were used to analyze the influence on pH value during rehydration. Chorion allantois membrane assay (CAM) was applied to check pro-angiogenic effects after 24, 48, and 72 h, followed by immunohistochemical analysis. Rehydration in injectable PRF showed acidity over time (p < 0.05). A definite pro-angiogenic effect of NM alone was found regarding neo-vessel formation supported by the respective light microscopically analysis without significant differences to PRF alone (p > 0.005). This pro-angiogenic effect could not be exaggerated when NM was combined with liquid/solid PRF (each p > 0.005). Rehydration with liquid PRF of the collagen membrane results in acidity compared to a saline solution or patient's blood. The significant pro-angiogenic potential of the membrane alone resulted in enhanced neo-vessel formation that could not be optimized with the addition of PRF. Using injectable PRF for rehydration protocol of the collagen membrane leads to acidosis that can ultimately optimize wound healing. Differences in the physio-mechanical interplay of collagen matrices and autologous platelet concentrates must result in clinical algorithms if pre-vascularization can maximize outcomes.","","Ya","0.00","1436-3771","28","1"

Recent studies have shown that this collagen membrane has osteoconductive properties, meaning that it can support the growth of new bone. However, it has also been observed that the collagen membrane has areas of mineralized fibers which can occur spontaneously and independently of osteoblasts. To better understand how this works, we established a model using minced collagen membranes to reduce the active mineralization of intact collagen membranes in favor of passive mineralization. We thus compared the original intact membrane with a minced collagen membrane in a 5 mm calvarial defect model in Sprague Dawley rats. After three weeks of healing, histology and microcomputed tomography (μCT) were performed. Histological analysis confirmed the osteoconductive properties, with new bone growing inside the intact collagen membrane. However, in minced collagen membranes, the osteoconductive properties were restricted to the defect margins. Interestingly, histology revealed large mineralized areas indicating passive mineralization with no signs of bone formation. In the μCT analysis, the intact collagen membranes caused a higher median mineralized volume (1.5 mm3) compared with the minced group (0.4 mm3), but this lacked significance (p = 0.09). The μCT analysis needs to be interpreted carefully, particularly in defects filled with minced membranes, considering that the mineralized tissue may not necessarily be bone but also the result of passive mineralization. Taken together, the findings suggest that Bio-Gide® collagen membranes support bone formation while also exhibiting potential for passive mineralization.","","Ya","0.00","2079-4983","15","3"

The calvarial defects were divided into four groups according to the particle type and the membrane application. All specimens were acquired 2 weeks (n = 5) and 8 weeks (n = 5) after surgery. According to the micro-CT results, the new bone volume increased at 2 weeks in the 76% OCP groups compared to the 90% OCP groups, and the bone volume ratio was significantly lower in the 90% OCP group after 2 weeks. The histomorphometric analysis results indicated that the new bone area and its ratio in all experimental groups were increased at 8 weeks except for the group with 90% OCP without a membrane. Furthermore, the residual bone graft area and its ratio in the 90% OCP groups were decreased at 8 weeks. In conclusion, all types of OCP could be applied as biocompatible bone graft materials regardless of its density and membrane application. Neither the OCP concentration nor the membrane application had a significant effect on new bone formation in the defect area, but the higher the OCP concentration, the less graft volume maintenance was needed.","","Ya","0.00","2306-5354","11","3"

This retrospective study aimed to assess the impact of a bone substitute material (i.e., Bio-Oss) on bone volume regeneration following maxillary radicular cyst enucleation using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Seventy-three patients with maxillary radicular cysts were divided into two groups: one undergoing guided bone regeneration (GBR) with Bio-Oss and absorbable collagen membrane (n = 35), and the other receiving cyst excision alone (n = 38). Volumetric measurements using Amira software on CBCT scans evaluated bone regeneration, with cystic lesion shrinkage rates calculated. Intergroup comparisons utilized independent sample t-tests (P < 0.05), and linear regression analysis assessed the influence of preoperative cyst volume and group on bone healing. Both groups showed similar success rates in bone formation at the 12-month follow-up, with no significant differences between them (mean (SD), control: 75.16 (19.17) vs. GBR: 82 (20.22), P > 0.05). Linear regression analysis revealed a negative correlation between preoperative cyst volume and bone regeneration in both groups (P < 0.05). Bio-Oss may not significantly enhance bone augmentation in maxillary radicular cysts. In addition, preoperative cyst volume negatively affected the shrinkage rate of cystic lesions. Clinicians should consider patient-specific factors such as anatomy and lesion size when determining the need for bone substitute materials. Future research could focus on optimizing treatment protocols and alternative regenerative strategies to improve patient outcomes in maxillary cyst cases.","","Ya","0.00","1436-3771","28","4"

At the same time, a cone beam computed tomography was performed to plan implant insertion through fully digital computer guided surgery. Bone was collected to perform histological and histomorphometric analysis. Pre and postoperative scans were compared using a specific software to estimate the volumetric changes. Tests were applied to investigate the relationship between the different predictor variables and the outcome variables. 14 patients were divided in 3 groups depending on the serum Vit-D levels, identifying three ranges corresponding to low (lower than 20), medium (between 20 and 30), and optimal vitamin D levels (higher than 30). Volumetric contraction after extraction was observed for all patients, without any significant difference between the groups. Focusing on the post-extraction regeneration, patients belonging to the group with lower levels of Vit-D displayed lower and more disorganized levels of bone. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that Col1A1 and Osteocalcin had no physiological alteration. Osteopontin could be identified near the external surface of bone tissue granules. Runx2 signals were detected near the margins of bone trabeculae. Serum vit-D levels do not appear to influence the extent of post-extraction bone contraction; on the contrary, they seem to influence the post-extraction regeneration. Vit D serum levels may influence the regenerative aspect during post-extraction turn-over.

A non-crosslinked membrane was used as reference control (RF). The initial in vitro cytotoxic analyses revealed that the PC, EC, and HMDI crosslinked membranes were cytocompatible, while the GA crosslinked membrane was cytotoxic and thus selected as positive control in the further in vivo study. Cross-linking enhances the tensile strength and collagenase resistance, effectively prolonging the membrane's standing time in vivo. Using (immune-) histochemistry and histomorphometrical analyses, the cellular inflammatory responses, tissue integration and vascularization patterns at 10-, 30-, and 90-day post-implantation in a subcutaneous implantation model in rats were analyzed. The PC membrane elicited the mildest inflammatory cell levels, akin to the RF membrane, while other groups induced an M1-dominated macrophage response and numerous multinucleated giant cells throughout the study period. EC membranes maintained structural stability up to 30 days post-implantation, similar to the GA group, whereas others collapsed prematurely. Concurrent with membrane collapse, transmembrane vascularization occurred across all groups.

Methods: For in vivo studies, we stablished membrane implantation models using 6-8 week-old male C57BL/6 mice. The degradation rates were explored through HE staining analysis at different time points (1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 28 d, 3 mice/group/time point). The influences of the two membranes on local macrophages and neovasculum were evaluated by immunofluorescence detection of F4/80 and CD31, and the mobilization effects of the two membranes on local stem cells were evaluated by immunohistochemical detection of Ki67 and CD146. For in vitro studies, mice periodontal ligament stem cells (mPDLSCs) were co-cultured with these two membrane materials, and the cell morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the gene expressions of Ki67, Cxcl1, Ccl1, Tnfa were investigated by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results: The results of in vivo studies showed that by day 28, there was no significant difference in degradation rate between these two membrane materials [SIS degradation rate: (16.84±4.00) %, Bio-Gide degradation rate: (24.07±3.97) %, P=0.090], illustrating that both of them could maintain the barrier effects for more than one month. In addition, there was no significant difference in the infiltration number of local F4/80 positive macrophages between these two groups by the day 3 after implantation [SIS: (20.67±5.69) cells/visual field, Bio-Gide: (25.33±2.52) cells/visual field, P=0.292]. However, compared with the Bio-Gide membrane, SIS membrane significantly promoted local CD31+vascular regeneration [SIS: (4.67±1.15) cells/visual field, Bio-Gide: (1.00±1.00) cells/visual field, P=0.015] and CD146+stem cell recruitment [SIS: (22.33±4.16) cells/visual field, Bio-Gide: (11.33±2.52) cells/visual field, P=0.025].

Our previous findings have indicated that the use of an absorbable collagen membrane (ACM) as a carrier for growth factors is effective in stimulating bone regeneration. The objective of this study was to assess the synergistic impact of BMP-9 incorporated into ACM (ACM/BMP-9) on bone formation within rat mandibular bone defects. Circular bone defects of critical size were surgically induced on both sides of the rat mandibular bone, with subsequent random allocation into distinct groups: control, ACM alone, and ACM loaded with low (0.5 μg) or high (2.0 μg) concentrations of BMP-9. We conducted real-time in vivo micro-computerized tomography scans at the baseline and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks, and measured the volume of newly formed bone (NFB), bone mineral density (BMD) of NFB, and the closure percentage of the NFB area. Histological and histomorphometric analyses were performed at 6 weeks. Real-time assessment revealed notably higher levels of bone volume, BMD, and closure percentage in the NFB area for the groups treated with ACM/BMP-9 compared to the control and ACM groups. Within the high concentration of BMP-9 group, the volume and BMD of NFB exhibited a significant increase at 6 weeks compared to baseline. Histological examination confirmed the existence of osteoblasts, osteocytes, and blood vessels within the NFB. Considering the limitations of this research, the real-time evaluation finding indicates that ACM/BMP-9 effectively promotes bone formation in critical-size mandibular defects in rats.","","Ya","0.00","2213-8862","19","4"

This strategy can exclude the need for additional procedures, such as non-resorbable membranes and major block grafting surgeries. Although the initial outcomes are promising, continuous follow-up is required to examine the stability of the newly regenerated bone and the long-term success of the implant. This case demonstrates the use of particulate bone grafts covered with a resorbable collagen membrane and supported by tenting screws to correct horizontal alveolar ridge defects. A man in his 40s presented with missing maxillary anterior central and lateral incisors and required a fixed dental prosthesis. One year before, #12, #11, #21, and #22 had been extracted. The area showed horizontal and slight vertical bone loss. We used a mixture of particulate bone grafts (xenografts and allografts) with tenting screws to prevent membrane collapse and covered the graft with a resorbable collagen membrane to guide bone regeneration. After 6 months, complete bone regeneration was achieved, and the dental implants were submerged in the bone. After another 6 months, the patient was administered with a fixed dental prosthesis.

Surgical reconstruction is often recommended for intrabony defects, accompanied by various adjunctive therapies, such as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), for bacterial decontamination. However, the long-term efficacy of such treatments remains unclear. This clinical report presents a case of peri-implantitis management in a healthy 55-year-old male using guided bone regeneration principles and surface decontamination via aPDT. The patient exhibited peri-implantitis with probing pocket depths (PPD) of 7 mm at buccal sites, 5 mm at palatal sites, and significant bone loss around implant #12. The reconstructive approach involved preservation of the existing implant and following a non-submerged healing protocol. The surgical phase included meticulous debridement, chemical detoxification with hydrogen peroxide, and aPDT using a 670 nm diode laser with methylene blue as the photosensitizer. Xenogenic bone graft and a resorbable collagen membrane were applied and the patient was followed up to through a 5-year period. Postsurgery the patient exhibited normal healing, and long-term follow-up at 5 years showed reduced PPD (2 mm buccally, 3 mm mid-palatally), complete intrabony defect fill, and stable bone levels, indicating successful treatment. This case report demonstrates the potential long-term success of a reconstructive approach with adjunctive aPDT in peri-implantitis management. However, it highlights the need for standardized protocols and further clinical trials to establish the clinical benefits of aPDT in surgical reconstruction of peri-implantitis defects, serving as valuable pilot data for future research. Why is this case new information? Provides a rare 5-year insight into peri-implantitis intrabony defect reconstruction, offering extended success and outcomes not frequently documented. Demonstrates the efficacy of aPDT with a 670-nm diode laser in achieving successful long-term outcomes, contributing valuable evidence to existing literature.Keys to successful management of this case: Success involves initial non-surgical debridement followed by a reconstructive strategy, incorporating guided bone regeneration and surface decontamination via aPDT. Long-term success hinges on patient compliance with routine oral hygiene, emphasizing the importance of adherence to preventive measures post-reconstruction to minimize recurrence risk.What are the primary limitations to success in this case? Variability in photosensitizer uptake, and potential risks such as tissue damage and bacterial resistance pose challenges to the effectiveness of aPDT. The existing literature on aPDT in peri-implantitis treatment lacks standardization in methodology, laser parameters, and follow-up durations, making it challenging to establish a universally accepted protocol.","","Ya","0.00","2163-0097","14","3"

Extraction sockets severely compromised by local infection, trauma, iatrogenesis, or other factors may exhibit enhanced reduction in alveolar dimensions during healing. The purpose of this report is to present an alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) protocol specifically intended for use at severely compromised sites. Seven patients presented to the Department of Periodontics, Army Postgraduate Dental School, Fort Gordon, Georgia, requiring extraction of teeth with partial or near-complete loss of the facial/buccal cortex. At each site, a cross-linked bovine collagen membrane was used to prevent collapse of the facial/buccal soft tissue and maintain space, a freeze-dried bone allograft was applied in the socket, and a dense polytetrafluoroethylene membrane covered the occlusal aspect. All sites healed uneventfully and resulted in favorable alveolar ridge dimensions for implant placement. Few authors have proposed specific ARP methods for managing severely deficient extraction sockets. The predominant recommendation has been staged reconstruction of the site applying hard and soft tissue augmentation. Observations reported herein suggest that staged reconstruction is avoidable at some extraction sockets exhibiting severe alveolar compromise. Controlled clinical investigation of this protocol appears warranted. Few authors have proposed alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) methods specifically intended for use at severely compromised extraction sockets. The prevailing recommendation at such sites is a staged protocol involving tooth extraction with delayed hard and soft tissue augmentation. The presented bilaminar ARP technique may eliminate the need for staged reconstruction at some severely compromised extraction sockets.","","Ya","0.00","2163-0097","14","1"

Adequate reconstruction of an extremely atrophic edentulous maxilla is a challenge, and different treatment methods have been described for its resolution. Patients seeking implant placement in edentulous upper jaw with atrophic maxilla were selected in a private clinic in Porto Alegre, Brazil. The bone graft was performed with bilateral sinus lift and horizontal bone graft in anterior region with 0,25-1mm particles of Bio-Oss (Geistlich) covered with a collagen membrane (Bio-Gide, Geistlich). CBCTs were evaluated to verify the need for bone graft, and 6-8 months after bone graft follow-up, to plan implant placement and assess horizontal bone gain. 124 implants were placed in 19 patients, 76 of those in the sinus region. The survival rate was 95.2%, with six implants lost over a mean implants follow-up time of 47.68 months. The horizontal bone gain ranged from 0.00 to 6.86 mm, a mean gain of 2.85mm. An average of 5.5g of Bio-Oss was used per patient, and in 73.7 % of the cases, a flapless surgery was possible for implant placement, and in 92 implants an immediate loading was possible. Final rehabilitation was accomplished with fixed prosthodontics in 16 patients with a mean follow-up of 38.4 months. Within the limitations of this study, it is possible to affirm that bone graft with 100% Bio-Oss in atrophic maxilla is a reliable treatment and allow rehabilitation with implants with a high survival rate and the higher the initial bone height, the greater the gain in bone width.

Ten patients of both sexes (7 women and 3 men), with ages ranging from 29 to 62 years, who needed a bidirectional horizontal bone augmentation in maxilla were separated in accordance with the horizontal alveolar change (HAC) classification published by Pelegrine et al (2018). The patients classified as HAC 3 (ie, containing remaining cancellous bone at the recipient bed) received the Barbell device with xenogeneic biomaterial and a collagen membrane, whereas HAC 4 patients (ie, with no remaining cancellous bone at the recipient bed) received the Barbell device with a mixture of autogenous bone chips and xenogeneic biomaterial covered by a collagen membrane. For each patient, two computerized tomography scans were performed (T0 at baseline and T1 at 6 months postoperative examinations).

The anti-C. albicans activity of the fractions (individually or combined with chlorhexidine) was evaluated using planktonic and sessile cultures. J774A.1 murine macrophage cells were used to determine the cytotoxicity and immunoresponsive effects of the therapies. The anti-planktonic and anti-sessile performance of chlorhexidine on C. albicans was improved 2- to 4-fold by supplementation with citral-rich fractions. On macrophages, this fraction also exhibited a potentially cytoprotective action against the toxic effects of chlorhexidine, minimizing damage to the cell membrane, mitochondrial membrane potential, and nuclear integrity. Macrophages growing on collagen-membrane fragments and stimulated with the citral fraction (alone or with chlorhexidine) showed a significant increase in releasing the osteogenic cytokine TNF-α and enhancing the IL-4.

Two different naturally sourced membranes were evaluated in this study: (i) an intact fish skin membrane (Kerecis Oral®, Kerecis) and (ii) a porcine derived collagen (Mucograft®, Geistlich) membrane, positive control. For the in vitro experiments, human osteoprogenitor (hOP) cells were used to assess the cellular viability and proliferation at 24, 48, 72, and 168 h. ALPL, COL1A1, BMP2, and RUNX2 expression levels were analyzed by real-time PCR at 7 and 14 days. The preclinical component was designed to mimic a GBR model in canines (n = 12). The first step was the extraction of premolars (P1-P4) and the 1st molars bilaterally, thereby creating four three-wall box type defects per mandible (two per side). Each defect site was filled with bone grafting material, which was then covered with one of the two membranes (Kerecis Oral® or Mucograft®). The groups were nested within the mandibles of each subject and membranes randomly allocated among the defects to minimize potential site bias. Samples were harvested at 30-, 60-, and 90-days and subjected to computerized microtomography (μCT) for three-dimensional reconstruction to quantify bone formation and graft degradation, in addition to histological processing to qualitatively analyze bone regeneration. Neither the intact fish skin membrane nor porcine-based collagen membrane presented cytotoxic effects. An increase in cell proliferation rate was observed for both membranes, with the Kerecis Oral® outperforming the Mucograft® at the 48- and 168-hour time points. Kerecis Oral® yielded higher ALPL expression relative to Mucograft® at both 7- and 14-day points. Additionally, higher COL1A1 expression was observed for the Kerecis Oral® membrane after 7 days but no differences were detected at 14 days. The membranes yielded similar BMP2 and RUNX2 expression at 7 and 14 days. Volumetric reconstructions and histologic micrographs indicated gradual bone ingrowth along with the presence of particulate bone grafts bridging the defect walls for both Kerecis Oral® and Mucograft® membranes, which allowed for the reestablishment of the mandible shape after 90 days. New bone formation significantly increased from 30 to 60 days, and from 60 to 90 days in vivo, without significant differences between membranes. The amount of bovine grafting material (%) within the defects significantly decreased from 30 to 90 days. Collagen membranes led to an upregulation of cellular proliferation and adhesion along with increased expression of genes associated with bone healing, particularly the intact fish skin membrane. Despite an increase in the bone formation rate in the defect over time, there was no significant difference between the membranes.","","Ya","0.00","1552-4981","111","11"

The organic-inorganic mixture phase of the collagen membrane evoked a prominent inflammatory response owing to the fluoride-containing amorphous calcium phosphate (F-ACP) nanoparticles, resulting in active angiogenesis and fibrous encapsulation, whereas the inorganic phase induced a mild inflammatory response and degraded the least owing to the transition of F-ACP particles into calcium phosphate with high crystallinity. Effective control of ACP is key to building novel apatite-based barrier membranes. The current results may pave the way for the development of advanced apatite-based membranes with enhanced barrier performances.","","Ya","0.00","1468-6996","24","1"

We hypothesized that an innovative non-animal IPN hydrogel combining self-setting silanized hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Si-HPMC) with photochemically cross-linkable dextran methacrylate (DexMA) could be a valid alternative to porcine collagen membranes in guided bone regeneration. Calvaria critical-size defects in rabbits were filled with synthetic biphasic calcium phosphate granules in conjunction with Si-HPMC; DexMA; or Si-HPMC/DexMA experimental membranes; and in a control group with a porcine collagen membrane. The synergistic effect obtained by interpenetration of the two polymer networks improved the physicochemical properties, and the gel point under visible light was reached instantaneously. Neutral red staining of murine L929 fibroblasts confirmed the cytocompatibility of the IPN. At 8 weeks, the photo-crosslinked membranes induced a similar degree of mineral deposition in the calvaria defects compared to the positive control, with 30.5 ± 5.2% for the IPN and 34.3 ± 8.2% for the collagen membrane. The barrier effect appeared to be similar in the IPN test group compared with the collagen membrane.

Collagen membranes stand out from other materials available for performing regenerative surgeries, and are widely used because of their ability to promote cell adhesion and homeostasis, and their biocompatibility, ease of handling, and low immunogenicity. In this context, researchers have investigated xenogenic membranes/barriers that cost less and have slower resorption rates. The current study aimed to assess the osteogenic potential induced by a crosslinked, synthesized xenogenic membrane 100 µm thick when applied in vivo to critical defects in rat calvaria. Critical size defects were created in the calvaria of thirty male Wistar rats, and randomly divided into the following two groups: G1 - clot covered with a commercial xenogenic membrane (Lumina-Coat®, Criteria, Brazil), and G2 - clot covered with a synthesized xenogenic membrane. The animals were euthanized after 7, 15 and 30 days, and samples of calvaria were processed to perform morphometric evaluations to measure bone neoformation in the defect region. In addition, ultrastructural characterization of the collagen membranes was performed by scanning electron microscope. The quantitative analyses were carried out by adopting a significance level of 5%. The ultrastructural characterization revealed that the synthesized membrane had thicker collagen fibers and a more cohesive surface, compared with the Lumina-Coat® collagen membrane (G1). There was no significant difference in bone neoformation between the membranes (p>0.05), at any of the time periods analyzed. The bone quantification area increased significantly over time for both membranes (p<0.05). The synthesized membrane exhibited morphological characteristics similar to those of the commercial membrane evaluated, allowed potentially active participation in the bone neoformation process, and served as a low-cost alternative for GBR procedures.","","Ya","0.00","2468-7855","124","1"

Then, tibiae were submitted to micro-CT. The membranes preserved their natural collagen characteristics, presenting great strength, high water absorption, hydrophilicity, and almost complete dissolution in 30 days.

The favorable bone quality made it possible to obtain the primary stability of two implants. At implant uncovering, a gingival graft augmented the keratinized mucosa width. Two screw-retained crowns were delivered 4 months after implant insertion and the 1-year follow-up showed perfectly maintained hard and soft tissues. A late TR-dPTFEM exposure, managed under strict hygiene control, did not affect this VRA. The augmented bone remained stable 1 year after prosthetic loading. Why is this case new information? A novel titanium reinforced PTFE mesh has been recently introduced for vertical ridge augmentation. This case report adds new information to the literature about the management and clinical outcome in a case of exposure. What are the keys to successful management of this case? Weekly check-up of the patient by the clinician Patient's ability to keep the wound clean and disinfected What are the primary limitations to success in this case? Impossibility of being able to check the patient at least once a week Acute infection.","","Ya","0.00","2163-0097","13","2"

From June 2019 to June 2023, patients who underwent GBR using buccal punch flap simultaneously with a single implant placement in posterior region (from first premolar to second molar) were divided into coverage group, in which particular bone graft was covered by collagen membrane and non-coverage group. Cone beam CT (CBCT) was taken before surgery (T0), immediately after surgery (T1), and 3-7 months after surgery (T2), and the thickness of the buccal bone plate at different levels (0, 2, 4, and 6 mm) below the smooth-rough interface of the implant (BBT-0, -2, -4, -6) was mea-sured after superimposition of CBCT models using Mimics software. A total of 29 patients, including 15 patients in coverage group and 14 patients in non-coverage group, were investigated in this study. At T0, T1, and T2, there was no significant difference in BBT between the two groups (P>0.05). At T1, BBT-0 was (2.50±0.90) mm in the coverage group and (2.97±1.28) mm in the non-coverage group, with corresponding BBT-2 of (3.65±1.08) mm and (3.58±1.26) mm, respectively. At T2, BBT-0 was (1.22±0.55) mm in the coverage group and (1.70±0.97) mm in the non-coverage group, with corresponding BBT-2 of (2.32±0.94) mm and (2.57±1.26) mm, respectively. From T1 to T2, there were no statistically significant differences in the absolute values [(0.47±0.54)-(1.33±0.75) mm] and percentages [(10.04%±24.81%)-(48.43%±18.32%)] of BBT change between the two groups. The thickness of new bone formation in the buccal bone plate from T0 to T2 ranged from (1.27±1.09) mm to (2.75±2.15) mm with no statistical difference between the two groups at all levels. In the short term, the GBR using buccal punch flap with or without collagen membrane coverage can effectively repair the buccal implant bone defect. But collagen membrane coverage showed no additional benefit on alveolar ridge contour stability compared with non-membrane coverage.","","Ya","0.00","1671-167X","55","6"

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis evidenced the presence of hydroxyl, orthophosphate, and carbonate groups of the xenografts and amide groups of collagen. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the xenografts demonstrated their thermal stability and the presence of a few amounts of organic material. The study by differential scanning calorimetry showed the presence of endothermic peaks typical of the dehydration of the xenografts (F1 and F2) and for the collagen membrane (F3), the beginning of structural three-dimensional protein changes. Subsequently, in vitro biocompatibility tests were carried out for the materials with Artemia salina and MTT cell viability with HeLa cells, demonstrating the high biocompatibility of the materials. Finally, in vivo biocompatibility was studied by implanting xenografts in biomodels (Wistar rats) at different periods (30, 60, and 90 days). The F1 xenograft (InterOss) remained remarkably stable throughout the experiment (90 days). F2 (InterOss Collagen) presented a separation of its apatite and collagen components at 60 days and advanced resorption at 90 days of implantation. Finally, the collagen membrane (F3) presented faster resorption since, at 90 days, only some tiny fragments of the material were evident.

The rabbits were divided into four groups: C1 (5 weeks postoperatively without membrane), C2 (8 weeks postoperatively without membrane), E1 (5 weeks postoperatively with membrane), and E2 (8 weeks postoperatively with membrane). The rabbits were killed 5 or 8 weeks after the operation and the newly formed bone was assessed histologically and radiographically. SMA devices, concealed under soft tissue until the time of euthanasia, did not cause active inflammation. The mean activation height, from the original bone surface to the midpoint of the mesh, was 3.1 ± 0.6 mm. Newly formed bone was observed, and most of the subperiosteal space underneath the device was occupied by fibrous tissue. Immature bone was present at the outer surface of the original skull bone in all groups. On histomorphometric analysis, there was no significant difference in the volume of the new bone between C1 and E1 (p = 0.885), and C2 and E2 (p = 0.545).

Furthermore, calvarial defects grafted with PEVAV/β-TCP 70 showed the highest NFBV among all grafting conditions, with a statistically significant difference recorded at 10 weeks post-surgery. The PEVAV/β-TCP composite scaffold showed potentiality for the regeneration of critical-sized calvarial bone defects in a rat model.","","Ya","0.00","1996-1944","14","9"

In six cynomolgus monkeys, two types of class III furcation defects were created and allowed to chronify for 5 months in mandibular first and second molars. After a hygiene program the molars were assigned to GTR group (collagen membrane plus bovine bone mineral), PDGF group (collagen membrane plus bovine bone mineral plus PDGF), or negative control group (flap reposition only). Histologic sections were made after 7 months of healing and descriptive statistics were provided from the histometric parameters. Postoperative healing was uneventful despite marginal membrane exposures in the GTR and PDGF group. Bone regeneration of 23-35% of the original defect area was found in the two treatment groups. In none of the evaluated key parameters (formation of bone, root cementum, connective tissue, or epithelium) differences were detected between GTR and PDGF groups. However, the negative control teeth exhibited better bone regeneration than the treatment groups. The type of class III defect did not influence the regenerative outcome. Within the limits of this study PDGF was not able to enhance the histologic regeneration of class III furcation areas in monkeys compared to bone mineral enhanced GTR treatment regardless of the defect configuration.

It is recommended to place the membranes with their dense layer towards the soft tissue and their porous layer towards the bony defect area. However, evidence supporting this recommendation is lacking. This study aimed to determine whether the alignment of bilayer collagen membranes has an effect on bone regeneration. In two groups of ten male Sprague-Dawley rats each, a 5-mm calvarial defect was created. Thereafter, the defect was randomly covered with a bilayer, resorbable, pure type I and III collagen membrane placed either regularly or upside-down (i.e., dense layer towards bone defect). After 4 weeks of healing, micro-computed tomography (μCT), histology, and histomorphometry of the inner cylindrical region of interest (4.5 mm in diameter) were performed to assess new bone formation and the consolidation of the collagen membrane in the defect area. Quantitative μCT showed similar bone volume (median 8.0 mm3, interquartile range 7.0-10.0 vs. 6.2 mm3, 4.3-9.4, p = 0.06) and trabecular thickness (0.21 mm, 0.19-0.23 vs. 0.18 mm, 0.17-0.20, p = 0.03) between upside-down and regular placement, both leading to an almost complete bony coverage. Histomorphometry showed comparable new bone areas between the upside-down and regularly placed membranes, 3.9 mm2 (2.7-5.4) vs. 3.8 mm2 (2.2-4.0, p = 0.31), respectively. Both treatment groups revealed the same regeneration patterns and spatial distribution of bone with and without collagen fibers, as well as residual collagen fibers.

Half of the sites were covered with a collagen membrane. Animals were euthanized after 12 weeks of healing. The samples were studied by micro-CT and histology. Newly formed lamellar bone was observed in all samples at the periphery of the defect. In the central areas, however, new bone composed of both woven and lamellar bone was embedded in the soft tissue. Samples treated with mCM showed more residual biomaterial and induced more small bony islands in the central areas of the defects than samples with CM. Nevertheless, a complete defect closure was not observed in any of the samples at 12 weeks. Membrane placement resulted in a decrease in bone density and height. Significant differences between the groups were revealed only between CM groups with and without membrane coverage for bone height in the central area of the defect. Neither mineralization of CM nor membrane placement improved the osteogenic capacity in this particular defect. Nevertheless, mineralisation influenced bone density without a membrane placement and bone volume underneath a membrane. CM may be used as a scaffold in bone regeneration procedures, without the need of a membrane coverage. Further preclinical studies are warrant to optimise the potential of mCM.","","Ya","0.00","2227-9059","9","2"

New bone formed underneath the membrane in defects in the CCM and UVM groups, with a distinctive new bone formation pattern, while new bone formed from the base of the defect in the NS and control groups. The CCM maintained its shape until 8 weeks, while the UVM and NS were fully degraded at 8 weeks; simultaneously, sustained inflammatory infiltration was found in the margin of the CCM, while it was absent in the UVM. In conclusion, the CCM showed longer longevity than the UVM, but was accompanied by higher levels of inflammation.

Twenty-five systemically healthy patients searching for implant rehabilitation and presenting with a horizontal ridge deficiency requiring bone augmentation before implant placement were included. Guided bone regeneration (GBR) was performed using the TTSB technique, involving the preparation of a collagen membrane that is perforated, folded, and sutured to form a bag that is then filled with a xenogeneic bone graft material. The bag is then inserted into a subperiosteal tunnel. Horizontal bone gain (HBG) was calculated 6 months after the surgery using CBCT. Healing was uneventful and with minimal morbidity. Average HBG was 3.7 ± 1.8 mm (P < .05), with a vertical component gain of 1.3 ± 1.7 mm (P > .05). In 12 patients, additional bone augmentation was required at the time of implant placement. A higher HBG was achieved in the maxilla than in the mandible (4.3 ± 1.3 mm vs 3.2 ± 1.8 mm, respectively; P < .05), and sites with an initial horizontal ridge width ≤ 3.5 mm were associated with a higher chance of requiring additional bone grafting at the time of implant placement compared to sites with an initial horizontal ridge width > 3.5 mm. The present case series demonstrated that TTSB is an effective approach for ridge augmentation prior to implant placement with minimal intra- and postoperative complications or patient morbidity.","","Ya","0.00","1945-3388","41","5"

To generate them, we need to fabricate collagen membranes that are porous.

Using a top-down approach, we explore a novel method for constructing porous collagen membranes via the combined application of bioskiving and sonication. Numerous collagen membranes with well-aligned fibril structures were rapidly fabricated by bioskiving and then sonicated at 30, 60, 90, and 120 W for 20 min. This treatment allowed us to study the effect of power intensity on the physicochemical traits of collagen membranes. Subsequently, the prepared collagen membranes were immersed in amorphous calcium phosphate to evaluate the feasibility of mineralization. Additionally, the bioactivities of the membranes were assessed using preosteoblast cells. Tuning the power intensity was shown to modulate fibril orientation, and the porous membrane without denatured collagen could be obtained by a 20-min sonication treatment at 90 W. The prepared collagen membrane could also be further mineralized to enhance osteogenesis.

Thus, this study aimed to describe the bone gain associated with GBR procedures combining membranes, bone grafts, and PRF for vertical and horizontal bone augmentation. Eighteen patients who needed vertical or horizontal bone regeneration before installing dental implants were included in the study. The horizontal bone defects were treated with a GBR protocol that includes the use of a mixture of particulate autogenous and xenogenous grafts in the proportion of 1:1, injectable form of PRF (i-PRF) to agglutinate the graft, an absorbable collagen membrane covering the regenerated region, and leukocyte PRF (L-PRF) membrane covering the GBR membrane. The vertical bone defects were treated with the same grafted mixture protected by a titanium-reinforced non-resorbable high-density polytetrafluoroethylene (d-PTFE-Ti) membrane and covered by L-PRF. The bone gain was measured using a cone-beam computed tomography at baseline and after a period of 7.5 (± 1.0) months. All patients underwent surgery to install implants after this regenerative protocol. The GBR produces an increase in bone thickness (p < 0.001) and height (p < 0.005) after treatment, with a bone gain of 5.9 ± 2.4 for horizontal defects and 5.6 ± 2.6 for vertical defects. In horizontal defects, the gain was higher in the maxilla than in mandible (p = 0.014) and in anterior than the posterior region (p = 0.033). No differences related to GBR location were observed in vertical defects (p > 0.05).

Materials & methods: 3D-printed scaffolds of biodegradable calcium phosphate and bioinert titanium were loaded with rhBMP-2 bone marrow aspirate, wrapped by a collagen membrane or a periosteum transplant and implanted into the greater omentum of miniature pigs. Results: Histological evaluation demonstrated significant bone formation within the first 8 weeks in both scaffolds. The periosteum transplant led to enhanced bone formation and a homogenous distribution in the scaffolds. The omentum tissue grew out a robust vascular supply. Conclusion: Endocultivation using 3D-printed scaffolds in the greater omentum is a very promising approach in defect-specific bone tissue regeneration.","","Ya","0.00","1746-076X","15","11"

A pre-surgical cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan was obtained for CTRAM design/fabrication and to evaluate pre-surgical ridge dimensions. Ridge augmentation surgery using CTRAM, freeze-dried bone allograft, and a resorbable collagen membrane was performed at each deficient site. Clinical measurements of the area of augmentation were made at the time of CTRAM placement and re-entry, and a 2nd CBCT scan 7 months after graft placement was used for volumetric analysis. Locations of each CTRAM in situ were also compared to their planned positions. Re-entry surgery and implant placement was performed 8 months after CTRAM placement. Nine subjects were treated with CTRAM and freeze-dried bone allograft. Four out of the nine patients enrolled (44.4%) experienced premature CTRAM exposure during healing, and in two of these cases, CTRAM were removed early. Early exposure did not result in total graft failure in any case. Mean volumetric bone gain was 85.5 ± 30.9% of planned augmentation volume (61.3 ± 33.6% in subjects with premature CTRAM exposure vs. 104.9% for subjects without premature exposure, p = 0.03). Mean horizontal augmentation (measured clinically) was 3.02 mm, and vertical augmentation 2.86 mm. Mean surgical positional deviation of CTRAM from the planned location was 1.09 mm. The use of CTRAM in conjunction with bone graft and a collagen membrane resulted in vertical and horizontal bone gain suitable for implant placement.","","Ya","0.00","2198-4034","6","1"

A total of 232 patients showing the same type of a two-piece implant placed either simultaneously with lateral bone grafting using a bovine bone mineral and a native collagen membrane (n = 291 implants; test group) or at pristine bone sites without lateral bone grafting (n = 283 implants; control group) were enrolled in this cross-sectional analysis. Clinical outcomes (i.e., modified plaque index (mPI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), and mucosal recession (MR)), and the frequency of peri-implant disease were evaluated after a mean follow-up period of 9.97 ± 6.55 years. No differences were found between the patients in the test and control groups for any of the parameters investigated (i.e., mPI, BOP, PD, and MR). For the implants in both groups, PD values of 4-6 mm were more frequently noted in the upper jaw. A significant correlation between increased PD values and a larger implant diameter was noted for test implant sites. A KM of < 2 mm was associated with increased MR values in both groups. The prevalence of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis was 68% and 5% for the patients in the test group and 61% and 10% in the control group, respectively. Simultaneous lateral grafting was associated with peri-implant tissue health and stability.","","Ya","0.00","2198-4034","6","1"

This study evaluated the effectiveness of porous polyethylene blocks used as an onlay bone graft in rabbit mandible in terms of tissue reaction, bone ingrowth, fibrovascularization, and graft-bone interfacial integrity. Twelve New Zealand white rabbits were randomized into 3 treatment groups according to the study period (4, 12, or 24 weeks). Cylindrical specimens measuring 5 mm in diameter and 4.5 mm in thickness were placed directly on the body of the mandible without bone bed decortication, fixed in place with a titanium screw, and covered with a collagen membrane. Histologic and histomorphometric analyses were done using hematoxylin and eosin-stained bone slices. Interfacial shear strength was tested to quantify graft-bone interfacial integrity. The porous polyethylene graft was observed to integrate with the mandibular bone and exhibited tissue-bridge connections. At all postoperative time points, it was noted that the host tissues had grown deep into the pores of the porous polyethylene in the direction from the interface to the center of the graft. Both fibrovascular tissue and bone were found within the pores, but most bone ingrowth was observed at the graft-mandibular bone interface. Bone ingrowth depth and interfacial shear strength were in the range of 2.76-3.89 mm and 1.11-1.43 MPa, respectively. No significant differences among post-implantation time points were found for tissue ingrowth percentage and interfacial shear strength (P>0.05). Within the limits of the study, the present study revealed that the new porous polyethylene did not provoke any adverse systemic reactions. The material promoted fibrovascularization and displayed osteoconductive and osteogenic properties within and outside the contact interface. Stable interfacial integration between the graft and bone also took place.","","Ya","0.00","2093-2278","50","2"

Thirty patients underwent to placement of a non-submerged implants with a laser-microtextured collar into the inter radicular septum of mandibular molar fresh extraction sockets. A collagen membrane and the mucoperiosteal flap were adapted around the neck of the implants, leaving the laser-microtextured collar to heal in a transmucosal fashion. At the end of the follow-up period, no statistical differences were found for each radiographic measurements used for the examination of extraction sockets vertical bone changes. Compared to implants placement, at the end of the 3-year follow-up, the vertical radiographic mesial and distal peri-implant marginal bone levels showed a statistically significant gain of 0.9 (SD 0.5), and 1.0 mm (SD 0.6), respectively (P=0.037). In mandibular fresh extraction sockets, the method of GBR around transmucosal implants with laser-microtextured surface placed into the interadicular septum may be used successfully to counteract the ridge remodelling.

A prospective experimental study was performed. Four bone defects in the tibiae of 12 rabbits were made and each of them was filled with DBBM, L-PRF, a combination of DBBM + L-PRF or was left to heal as control site. All defects were covered with a collagen membrane. Rabbits were randomly distributed in three groups and euthanatized at 3, 6 or 9 weeks. Samples were obtained and histologically analyzed to determine vital bone, connective tissue and remaining graft particles percentage. Analysis of variance, Kruskal Wallis and non-paired t-test where used to evaluate the significance of the results. At 3 weeks of healing, DBBM showed significantly more vital bone percentage than L-PRF (p = 0,05) and DBBM + L-PRF showed significantly less connective tissue than control (p < 0,05). All other groups showed no statistical difference between them. At 6 weeks of healing, DBBM showed significantly more vital bone percentage than L-PRF (p < 0,05), DBBM + L-PRF (p < 0,05) and control (p < 0,05) and there wasn't any other significant difference regarding to connective tissue or remaining particle percentage between groups. At t 9 weeks healing period, there weren't any significant differences between groups. DBBM seems to enhance vital bone formation at early healing stages. The use of L-PRF alone or combined with DBBM, didn't show any histological improvement regarding to vital bone formation. The use of DBBM, alone or in conjunction with L-PRF showed a trend to reduce connective tissue percentage. The use of L-PRF combined with DBBM didn't affect the remaining particle percentage.","","Ya","0.00","2212-4268","10","3"

Health sciences","","10.19723/j.issn.1671-167X.2020.03.025","Journal Article","To study the biodegradation properties of multi-laminated small intestinal submucosa (mSIS) through in vitro and in vivo experiments, comparing with Bio-Gide, the most widely used collagen membrane in guided bone regeneration (GBR) technique, for the purpose of providing basis to investigate whether mSIS meets the requirements of GBR in dental clinics. The degradation properties were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro degradation was performed using prepared collagenase solution. Morphology of mSIS and Bio-Gide in degradation solution were observed and the degradation rate was calculated at different time points. In in vivo experiments, nine New Zealand rabbits were used for subcutaneous implantation and were divided into three groups according to observation intervals. Six unconnected subcutaneous pouches were made on the back of each animal and were embedded with mSIS and Bio-Gide respectively. At the end of weeks 4, 8, and 12 after operation, gross observation and HE staining were used to evaluate the degree of degradation and histocompatibility. In vitro degradation experiments showed that mSIS membrane was completely degraded at the end of 12 days, while Bio-Gide was degraded at the end of 7 days. Besides, mSIS maintained its shape for longer time in the degradation solution than Bio-Gide, indicating that mSIS possessed longer degradation time, and had better ability to maintain space than Bio-Gide. In vivo biodegradation indicated that after 4 weeks of implantation, mSIS remained intact. Microscopic observation showed that collagen fibers were continuous with a few inflammatory cells that infiltrated around the membrane. Bio-Gide was basically intact and partially adhered with the surrounding tissues. HE staining showed that collagen fibers were partly fused with surrounding tissues with a small amount of inflammatory cells that infiltrated as well. Eight weeks after operation, mSIS was still intact, and was partly integrated with connective tissues, whereas Bio-Gide membrane was mostly broken and only a few residual fibers could be found under microscope. Only a small amount of mSIS debris could be observed 12 weeks after surgery, and Bio-Gide could hardly be found by naked eye and microscopic observation at the same time. In vitro degradation time of mSIS is longer than that of Bio-Gide, and the space-maintenance ability of mSIS is better. The in vivo biodegradation time of subcutaneous implantation of mSIS is about 12 weeks and Bio-Gide is about 8 weeks, both of which possess good biocompatibility.","","Ya","0.00","1671-167X","52","3"
