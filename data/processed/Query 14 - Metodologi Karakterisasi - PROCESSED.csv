The control was commercially available collagen membranes; PRF membranes were produced using a normal centrifugation technique. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine structural features. Key growth factors-including transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Using scratch tests, we assessed wound healing capacity and fibroblast migration. The student's t-test was used for statistical analysis; P < 0.001 was considered to be significant. While collagen membranes showed a consistent porosity shape, PRF showed a rich fibrin network, including embedded platelets and leukocytes. At 14 days, PRF showed much more cell growth (P < 0.001). Growth factor analysis showed that PRF generated more TGF-β1, PDGF-BB, and VEGF with consistent release (P < 0.001). PRF shows greater healing properties than collagen membranes with enhanced cellular proliferation, movement, and release of growth factors. These results suggest that PRF might be a more effective biomaterial for use in guided tissue regeneration.","","Parsial","0.00","0976-4879","17",""

In this study, we developed a biogenic collagen membrane by combining citrate (C) pretreatment and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC)-mediated mineralization and further evaluated its bone healing potential. Methods: C-CMC collagen membranes were prepared by lyophilization. The mineral composition and content were tested through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The micromorphology was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). Physical and mechanical properties, including the swelling rate, porosity, hydrophilicity, tensile strength, Young's modulus, degradation, and barrier function, were also evaluated. Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were cultured in vitro to observe their behavior. An in vivo critical-size rat calvarial defect model was used to validate the effects of the membrane on bone regeneration. Results: The C-CMC collagen membrane was successfully synthesized as a collagen-hydroxyapatite complex with intrafibrillar mineralization, exhibiting improved mechanical properties and an optimal swelling rate, porosity, hydrophilicity, and degradation rate. Additionally, the C-CMC collagen membrane promoted BMSC proliferation, adhesion, and osteogenesis while preventing epithelial cell infiltration. In vivo experiments indicated that C-CMC collagen membranes significantly stimulated bone regeneration without causing systemic toxicity. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the C-CMC collagen membrane possesses satisfactory physical and mechanical properties, along with good biocompatibility and efficacy in bone defect regeneration, making it a potential candidate for a bioactive guided bone regeneration membrane in clinical applications.","","Parsial","0.00","2079-4983","16","7"

Efforts to reduce the production of hard-to-recycle waste are becoming increasingly important to manufacturers, not only of consumer goods but also of specialized items that are difficult to manufacture, such as medical supplies, which have now become a priority for the European Union. The purpose of the study is to manufacture a novel human-purified type I collagen membrane from bone remnants typically discarded during the processing of cortico-cancellous bones in tissue banks and to evaluate its mechanical properties and effectiveness in regenerating bone-critical mandibular defects in rabbits. To prepare the novel membrane, cortico-cancellous bone chip samples from a local tissue bank were processed to isolate collagen by demineralization under agitation in HCl, cast into a silicone mold, and air-dried at room temperature and UV irradiation. The average thickness of the four batches analyzed by SEM was 37.3 μm. The average value of Young's modulus and tensile strength obtained from the specimens was 2.56 GPa and 65.43 Mpa, respectively. The membrane's efficacy was tested by creating a critical bicortical and bilateral osteoperiosteal defect in rabbit mandibles. The right-side defects were covered with the collagen membrane, while the left-side defects were left untreated as a control. Nine weeks post-surgery, clinical, radiological, and histological analyses demonstrated new bone formation in the treated areas, whereas the control sites showed no bone regeneration. This innovative approach not only contributes to sustainability in healthcare by optimizing biological waste but also exemplifies efficient resource use in line with the circular economy, offering a cost-effective, biocompatible option that could benefit national health systems.","","Parsial","0.00","2218-273X","15","1"

The impact of this radiation on collagen, a primary structural protein in humans, remains underexplored, particularly at varying doses and hydration states. This study explores the impact of ionizing radiation on type I collagen fibrils at three radiation doses (diagnostic, therapeutic, and sterilization) and under two hydration conditions using an engineered acellular collagen membrane to reflect varying biological conditions. Techniques including atomic force microscopy (AFM), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were utilized to assess changes in mechanical properties, biochemical stability, and molecular structure respectively. Our results demonstrate that ionizing radiation alters the mechanical properties of collagen fibrils, notably indentation modulus, which reflects changes in stiffness or elasticity. These modifications depended on the hydration state at the time of radiation exposure; hydrated fibrils typically exhibited increased stiffness, suggesting enhanced cross-linking, whereas dehydrated fibrils showed reduced stiffness, indicative of structural weakening, possibly due to bond breakdown. Morphological changes were minimal, suggesting that radiation primarily affects the internal structure rather than the overall appearance of the fibrils. Biochemically, variations in fluorescence lifetimes highlighted changes in the collagen's biochemical environment, dependent on the dose and hydration state. Despite these biochemical and mechanical changes, FTIR analysis indicated that the primary structure of collagen was largely preserved post-irradiation for all examined dose levels. These findings imply that radiation can modify the mechanical properties of collagen, potentially affecting tissue integrity in clinical settings. This could influence the management of radiation-induced conditions like osteoradionecrosis, fibrosis and cancer metastasis. Overall, our study underscores the need for further research into the effects of radiation on structural proteins to better understand and mitigate radiation-induced tissue damage.","","Parsial","0.00","1932-6203","20","4"

The CCM facilitates enhanced ionic and water transport between the cathode and the anion exchange membrane (AEM). This advantage is particularly significant with AEM water electrolysis (compared to proton exchange membrane water electrolysis) because the cathode typically operates under dry conditions and relies solely on diffusive water transport across the AEM from the liquid-fed anode. This study presents a direct performance comparison between CCS and CCM cathode configurations using identical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts and other components. The use of a pseudo-reference electrode integrated into the membrane electrode assembly enabled detailed analysis of the CCM cathode polarization behavior. Surface characterization provided insight into the degradation mechanisms associated with the CCM configuration. Optimization of the cathode ionomer cross-link density improved both the cathode polarization performance and the electrolysis device durability. Further optimization of the HER catalyst loading in the CCM cathode resulted in additional gains in the electrolysis efficiency. Collectively, these findings offer valuable guidance for the design and fabrication of high-performance, durable AEM electrolysis CCMs.","","Parsial","0.00","2997-0571","1","11"

The current study aimed to introduce coated nanoporous membranes for localized drug delivery of donepezil, combining both antifouling activity and sustained drug release, unlike traditional Alzheimer's treatments that rely on systemic administration. Nanoporous membranes were prepared by electrochemical anodization, coated with Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or a PMMA/polyurethane (PU) mixture to mitigate biofouling. The fabricated nanoporous membranes before and after coating were characterized using SEM/EDX, FTIR, BET, and contact angle measurements. In vitro drug release and release kinetics were studied in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Coated and donepezil loaded membranes were implanted on the dura surface in Wistar rats AD model via intracerebral streptozotocin (STZ) injection. The activity was evaluated on behavioral, biochemical and histological levels. PMMA enhanced membrane hydrophobicity (contact angle increased from 62.8° to 79°) and sustained drug release over 7 days, making it the preferred coating. The PMMA membrane demonstrated a reduction in beta-amyloid levels without being loaded with donepezil, while the donepezil-loaded membrane showed cognitive function improvement in Morris water maze and Y-maze. Acetylcholinesterase activity was elevated after STZ-induction of AD and got ameliorated by the membranes implantation. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) was lowered by STZ, while increased in treated animals. Histological examination revealed the neuronal regeneration after donepezil-loaded PMMA coated membrane. These findings suggest that coated nanoporous membranes are promising systems for localized active donepezil drug delivery for AD-like symptoms modulation in STZ-induced AD model, warranting further validation in other AD paradigms.","","Parsial","0.00","2045-2322","15","1"

ESMs were extracted using a standardized protocol. Membranes were then analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), contact angle measurements (CAM), and cell culture-based assays. FTIR revealed similar collagen spectra among membranes. SEM showed structural similarities between ESMs and Bio-Gide. DSC indicated integrity maintenance at 37°C and varied storage conditions. CAM testing demonstrated collagen-based membranes' higher hydrophilicity compared to d-PTFE. DMA analysis showed duck ESM's superior tensile strength and Young's modulus compared to chicken ESM and porcine CM. Biological evaluation revealed high compatibility with human gingival fibroblasts for all materials.

In addition, assessment to the biocompatibility, through fibroblasts/keratinocytes and in vitro wound healing essays were performed. The obtained results show that the new 2,3-DHB loaded chitosan/collagen membrane presented high porosity and swelling capacity as well as maximum strength, hydrophilicity, and antioxidant activity higher in relation to the control. The tests of antileishmanial activity and the AFM images demonstrate great efficacy of inhibition growth of the parasite, superior to those from the standard therapeutic agent that is currently used: Amphotericin B. The new membranes are biocompatible and stimulated the proliferation of keratinocytes. SEM images clearly demonstrate that fibroblasts were able to adhere, maintained their characteristic morphology. The healing test evidenced that the membranes have adequate environment for promoting cell proliferation and growth.

This study aimed to overcome the problems of batch culture using the controlled release concept by a controlled porosity osmotic pump (CPOP) system. The CPOP was formulated with glucose as a carbon source feeding and sodium carbonate as a pH modifier in the core of the tablet that was coated with a semipermeable membrane containing cellulose acetate and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400. The release rate was regulated with Eudragit L100 as a retardant agent in the core and PEG 400 as a pore-former agent in the coating membrane. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to elucidate compatibility between components and release mechanism, respectively. The in-vitro release of glucose and Na2CO3 studies were performed for 24 hours in a mineral culture medium (M9). Then, the effectiveness of CPOP in the growth of Escherichia coli (E. coliBL21) as a microorganism model was evaluated. Glucose consumption, changes in medium's pH, and acetate concentration as a by-product were also monitored during the bacterial growth. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the compatibility between the components in the osmotic pump, and SEM elucidated the release mechanism due to in-situ delivery pores created by dissolving soluble components (PEG 400) on the coated membrane upon contact with the dissolution medium. The in-vitro release studies indicated that the osmotic pump was able to deliver glucose and sodium carbonate in a zero-order manner. The use of CPOP in E. coli (BL21) cultivation resulted in a statistically significant improvement in biomass (over 80%), maintaining the pH of the medium (above 6.8) during the exponential phase, and reducing metabolic by-product formation (acetate), compared to bolus feeding (P < 0.05). The use of CPOP, which is capable of controlled release of glucose as a carbon source and sodium carbonate as a pH modifier, can overcome the drawbacks of bolus feeding, such as decreased pH, increased acetate concentration, and low productivity. It has a good potential for commercialization.","","Ya","0.00","1726-6890","23","1"

After preparation, they were subjected to scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDAX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and contact angle test. In SEM analysis, spherical in size, uniformly dense, and porous agglomeration was noticed. EDAX and FTIR revealed the formation of MgONPs (magnesium oxide) in the membrane. The average contact angles of the CS with MgONPs and control membranes were 85.48° and 80.80°, respectively. Degradation analysis showed that test membrane showed a slower degradation rate than control collagen membrane at the end of the 28th day. On comparing membranes with pure CS, membranes with nanoparticles, and control collagen membranes, the membrane incorporated with nanoparticles showed more favorable positive outcomes.","","Ya","0.00","0972-124X","28","5"

This study aimed to investigate the proliferation and adhesion of human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells to a collagen membrane following PBM. Methods: Cultured HGF cells on a collagen membrane received PBM at wavelengths of 808 nm, 915 nm (2 and 4 J/cm2), and 660 nm (2.1 and 4.2 J/cm2) in interventional groups, while non-irradiated cells served as the control. On days 1 and 3 post-irradiation, cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay, and adhesion to the membrane was assessed under the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results: Cell proliferation significantly increased in interventional groups compared to the control, with the most significant increase at 915 nm (4 J/cm2) in both time points. On the first day, the 808 nm and 660 nm lasers demonstrated similar results, significantly lower than the 915 nm laser (2 J/cm2). On day 3, the 660 nm, 808 nm, and 915 nm (2 J/cm2) groups showed comparable results. Qualitative analysis by the SEM identified spindle-shaped cells with multiple extended projections in 915 nm groups, especially at an energy density of 4 J/cm2. Groups of 660 nm and 808 nm (4 J/cm2) showed spindle-shaped cell morphology. No distinct cellular morphology indicative of enhanced adhesion was observed at 808 nm (2 J/cm2). Conclusion: The most effective PBM setup for promoting HGF proliferation and adhesion to a collagen membrane was identified at 915 nm (4 J/cm2).","","Parsial","0.00","2008-9783","15",""

Collagen membranes stand out from other materials available for performing regenerative surgeries, and are widely used because of their ability to promote cell adhesion and homeostasis, and their biocompatibility, ease of handling, and low immunogenicity. In this context, researchers have investigated xenogenic membranes/barriers that cost less and have slower resorption rates. The current study aimed to assess the osteogenic potential induced by a crosslinked, synthesized xenogenic membrane 100 µm thick when applied in vivo to critical defects in rat calvaria. Critical size defects were created in the calvaria of thirty male Wistar rats, and randomly divided into the following two groups: G1 - clot covered with a commercial xenogenic membrane (Lumina-Coat®, Criteria, Brazil), and G2 - clot covered with a synthesized xenogenic membrane. The animals were euthanized after 7, 15 and 30 days, and samples of calvaria were processed to perform morphometric evaluations to measure bone neoformation in the defect region. In addition, ultrastructural characterization of the collagen membranes was performed by scanning electron microscope. The quantitative analyses were carried out by adopting a significance level of 5%. The ultrastructural characterization revealed that the synthesized membrane had thicker collagen fibers and a more cohesive surface, compared with the Lumina-Coat® collagen membrane (G1). There was no significant difference in bone neoformation between the membranes (p>0.05), at any of the time periods analyzed. The bone quantification area increased significantly over time for both membranes (p<0.05). The synthesized membrane exhibited morphological characteristics similar to those of the commercial membrane evaluated, allowed potentially active participation in the bone neoformation process, and served as a low-cost alternative for GBR procedures.","","Parsial","0.00","2468-7855","124","1"

In this manuscript, we demonstrate the results of the molecular structure study of collagen from Dosidicus gigas and reveal the possibility of obtaining a thin membrane material. The collagen membrane is characterized by high flexibility and plasticity as well as mechanical strength. The technology of obtaining collagen scaffolds, as well as the results of studies of its mechanical properties, surface morphology, protein composition, and the process of cell proliferation on its surface, are shown in the given manuscript. The investigation of living tissue culture grown on the surface of a collagen scaffold by X-ray tomography on a synchrotron source made it possible to remodel the structure of the extracellular matrix. It was found that the scaffolds obtained from squid collagen are characterized by a high degree of fibril ordering and high surface roughness and provide efficient directed growth of the cell culture. The resulting material provides the formation of the extracellular matrix and is characterized by a short time to living tissue sorption.","","Ya","0.00","2073-4360","15","5"

However, absorbable membranes such as collagen have their own disadvantages such as unpredictable degradation rates, poor rigidity leading to tissue collapse, and limited osteogenic properties and cell adhesion. In this study, a modified collagen membrane with a polydopamine-graphene oxide (PDA/GO) complex was synthesized to improve the characteristics of collagen for bone tissue engineering. The successful synthesis of PDA/GO on collagen membranes was verified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The wettability of PDA/GO-modified collagen membranes was considerably improved based on the characterization by water contact angle compared to the uncoated membranes and surface coatings solely by either PDA or GO. The modified PDA/GO coating also enhanced the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and biodegradation rate of collagen membranes. In addition, the PDA/GO coating effectively enhanced the biocompatibility of collagen membranes as verified by the enhanced proliferation and adhesion of human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs). Additionally, the effects of PDA/GO coating on the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs on collagen membranes were investigated through alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The PDA/GO coating on collagen membranes resulted in a significant increase in osteogenic properties compared with the uncoated collagen membranes. According to the results of the current study, the combination of PDA and GO-modified collagen membranes could be used for bone tissue engineering and biomedical applications.","","Ya","0.00","2576-6422","6","11"

Some disadvantages, such as rapid degradation and questionable mechanical properties, limit their clinical use. These membranes have a heterologous origin and may proceed from different tissues. Biomineralization is a process in which hydroxyapatite deposits mainly in collagen fibrils of the matrices. However, when this deposition occurs on the ECM, its mechanical properties are increased, facilitating bone regeneration. The objective of the present research is to ascertain if different membranes from distinct origins may undergo biomineralization. Nanomechanical properties, scanning electron (SEM) and multiphoton (MP) microscopy imaging were performed in three commercially available ECMs before and after immersion in simulated body fluid solution for 7 and 21 d. The matrices coming from porcine dermis increased their nanomechanical properties and they showed considerable mineralization after 21 d, as observed in structural changes detected through SEM and MP microscopy. It is hypothesized that the more abundant crosslinking and the presence of elastin fibers within this membrane explains the encountered favorable behavior.","","Parsial","0.00","2073-4360","14","16"

A total of fourteen patients (n = 14 implants) diagnosed with peri-implantitis underwent access flap surgery, granulation tissue removal, implantoplasty, and augmentation at intra-bony components using a natural derived bone mineral and application of a native collagen membrane during a standardized surgical procedure. Granulation tissue biopsies were prepared for immunohistochemical characterization and macrophage polarization assessment. M1 and M2 phenotype expression was identified and quantified through immunohistochemical markers and histomorphometrical analyses. Clinical evaluation and data collection were performed initially and after a healing period of 6 months. Statistical analyses were performed to associate infiltrated area, macrophage, and M1/M2 phenotype influence on peri-implant tissue healing parameters after a 6-month follow-up. Mean infiltrated compartment (ICT) values occupied a total percentage of 70.3% ± 13.0 in the analyzed granulation tissue biopsies. Macrophages occupied a mean area of 15.3% ± 7.0. M1 and M2 phenotypes were present in 7.1 ± 4.1% and 5.5 ± 3.7%, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed between M1 and M2% expression (p = 0.16). The mean M1/ M2 ratio amounted to 1.5 ± 0.8. Surgical therapy was associated with statistically significant reductions in mean bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD) and suppuration (SUPP) scores at 6 months (p < 0.05). Linear regression analyses revealed a significant correlation between macrophage expression (CD68%) and changes in PD scores and M1 (%) expression and changes in mucosal recession (MR) scores at 6 months. The present data suggest that macrophages might influence peri-implant tissue healing mechanisms following surgical therapy of peri-implantitis over a short-term period. Particularly, changes in PD and MR scores were statistically significantly associated with macrophage expression and phenotype.","","Parsial","0.00","2198-4034","7","1"

The study comprised an in vitro test and a clinical trial for membrane evaluation. BCP-added collagen membranes with UV cross-linking were prepared. In the in vitro test, scanning electron microscopy, a collagenase assay, and a tensile strength test were performed. The clinical trial involved 14 patients undergoing a ridge preservation procedure. All participants were randomly divided into the test group, which received UV cross-linked membranes (n=7), and the control group, which received chemically cross-linked membranes (n=7). BCP bone substitutes were used for both the test group and the control group. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans were performed and alginate impressions were taken 1 week and 3 months after surgery. The casts were scanned via an optical scanner to measure the volumetric changes. The results were analyzed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. The fastest degradation rate was found in the collagen membranes without the addition of BCP. The highest enzyme resistance and the highest tensile strength were found when the collagen-to-BCP ratio was 1:1. There was no significant difference in dimensional changes in the 3-dimensional modeling or CBCT scans between the test and control groups in the clinical trial (P>0.05). The addition of BCP and UV cross-linking improved the biocompatibility and the mechanical strength of the membranes. Within the limits of the clinical trial, the sites grafted using BCP in combination with UV cross-linked and BCP-added collagen membranes (test group) did not show any statistically significant difference in terms of dimensional change compared with the control group.","","Ya","0.00","2093-2278","50","4"
