However, conventional 2D culture platforms fail to replicate the aligned architecture characteristic of vascular tissues. This study investigates whether a poly (vinyl alcohol)-stearate (PVA-stearate) surface coating can differentially modulate protein adsorption to direct extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly and cell alignment. The PVA-stearate conjugate was synthesized via esterification and extensively characterized by XRD, DSC, TGA, FTIR, AFM, and XPS, confirming successful chemical integration and a uniform nanoscale topography with moderate roughness compared to uncoated controls. Protein interaction analyses (MALDI-TOF and BCA assays) revealed selective suppression of non-specific globular protein adsorption (albumin, insulin) while facilitating collagen fibrillar assembly. Fibroblast (L929) cultures on the modified surfaces exhibited delayed initial adhesion followed by progressive elongation, unidirectional alignment, and coordinated cytoskeletal organization within 48 h, whereas unmodified substrates supported random orientation and disordered ECM deposition. These findings demonstrate that the PVA-stearate coating functions as a bioinstructive interface, enabling protein-specific modulation and guiding biomimetic cell-ECM interactions. This scalable and fully synthetic approach offers promising applications in vascular tissue engineering, antifibrotic surface design, and regenerative medicine platforms requiring controlled cellular organization.","","Parsial","0.00","1097-0282","117","1"

These complications undermine the efficacy of conventional bone repair materials, limiting their capacity to promote effective healing. Herein, we developed a metal-flavonoid functionalized coating strategy that integrates osteogenic and angiogenic metal ions with natural antioxidant flavonoids. Leveraging their chelation ability and strong surface affinity, a one-pot approach is established to endow conventional bone repair materials with tailored biofunctions that modulate the diabetic bone microenvironment and facilitate regeneration. Among the tested candidates, copper-quercetin (CQ) coating is screened as the optimal formulation owing to its potent antioxidative, osteoinductive, and pro-angiogenic properties under high-glucose (HG) conditions. Conventional bone repair materials (e.g., β-tricalcium phosphate, β-TCP) modified with this coating significantly ameliorated oxidative stress, restored osteogenesis, and rescued angiogenesis impaired by persistent hyperglycemia. In diabetic rats, CQ-coated β-TCP (β-TCP@CQ) accelerated bone healing by 1.68-fold compared to unmodified controls. Mechanistically, the CQ coating activated the ATP7A/SOD3/FLT1 axis to restore copper homeostasis in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells while stimulating the PI3K-Akt pathway to enhance osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, the coating exhibited broad versatility across multiple biomaterial compositions (metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites) and structures (2D discs, 3D scaffolds). This metal-flavonoid coating strategy demonstrated feasibility and scalability, while also providing a mechanistic foundation and technical platform for the effective use of conventional bone repair materials in complex pathological contexts.","","Ya","0.00","2198-3844","",""

However, these particles often lack the compositional and structural complexity of their biogenic counterparts and fail to capture the intrinsic heterogeneity of bone mineral across spatial and temporal scales. Here, a series of organic-inorganic composites containing well-defined proxies for biogenic calcium phosphate particles at successive stages of bone biomineralization reveals that osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells increases significantly for partially crystalline hydroxyapatite nanoparticles coated with a hydrophilic amorphous surface layer whose proportion reaches at least 35 %. This coating occurs naturally on bone hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, with a proportion that decreases as the particles age, and may contribute to the unparalleled clinical success of autologous bone grafts. Mechanistically, a hydration shell of tightly bound water molecules on the amorphous layer is proposed to enhance binding of extracellular signaling molecules at the cell-material interface, amplifying osteogenic commitment. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for previous observations that biomimetic hydroxyapatite particles outperform their highly crystalline counterparts, underscore the critical importance of truly bone-mimetic material designs for next-generation bone-regenerative therapies, and offer an unprecedented view of how biophysical surface cues direct stem-cell function. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Amorphous chemical environments naturally occur around the particles of a variety of biominerals, yet they have mainly been associated with physicochemical processes such as ion exchange, crystal growth, and particle assembly. Focusing on bone bioapatite, a calcium phosphate biomineral of major clinical relevance, we show that these amorphous environments also have biological functions. Using a unique series of well-characterized proxies for biogenic calcium phosphate particles at different stages of bone biomineralization, we reveal the critical role of these amorphous chemical environments in regulating osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells. These results emphasize the importance of truly biomimetic designs for developing transformative biomaterials for bone repair and provide mechanistic insight into how nanoscale surface features influence stem cell behavior.","","Parsial","0.00","1878-7568","210",""

Therefore, rational scaffold design and fabrication methods are crucial for achieving optimal performance. This study introduces an innovative approach to the design of scaffolds for abdominal wall repair, using topology optimization and melt electrowriting (MEW). Through topology optimization, we provided a systematic, data-driven basis for scaffold design. We further refined the scaffold structure to enhance print efficiency and continuity, and successfully implemented MEW as fabrication technology, marking its first application in abdominal repair. Mechanical testing revealed that the topology-optimized scaffold achieved abdominal tensile strength of 1.85 ± 0.02 N/cm, 39 % superior to conventional designs. Subsequent biological assessments - including fibroblast proliferation and alignment analyses - showed that collagen coating significantly enhanced cell attachment and proliferation, especially in multi-layer (300 layers) scaffolds, maintaining diameters of 11.34 ± 0.67 μm throughout the depth. Finally, ex vivo porcine abdominal wall tests confirmed clinical mechanical suitability. This work offers a promising direction for future advancements in tissue engineering, particularly in optimizing scaffold structures for biological and mechanical performance.","","Parsial","0.00","2452-199X","55",""

However, their nanoscale thickness and gaps caused by steric hindrance between clusters often lead to instability, limiting their applications. This study exploits the self-assembly of benzophenone-functionalized polymers into clusters in non-aqueous solvents, which are subsequently ""frozen"" and anchored to the surface through an evaporation-assisted grafting strategy to form stable, stacked polymer cluster coatings. This process is related to the rate of solvent removal and the proportion of benzophenone in the copolymer. This unique structure yields antifouling coatings with superior, sustained resistance to contaminants due to its closely stacked clusters. Moreover, this method can be extended to the preparation of stacked heparin-mimetic polymer cluster coatings that exhibit native binding of endothelial cell growth factors, inducing endothelial network formation, a capability not achievable with traditional methods. In vivo, the coating reduced inflammatory encapsulation and facilitated rapid endothelial organization and vessel-like remodeling at the implant-tissue interface. This strategy highlights the pivotal role of interfacial architectures and molecular interactions in guiding cellular behaviour, providing a distinct perspective on the development of high-performance coatings. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Our study introduces an evaporation-assisted grafting strategy to fabricate stacked polymer cluster coatings, overcoming the instability of traditional polymer brushes. These coatings demonstrate exceptional antifouling performance and support the versatile integration of functional components.

Medpor®, a porous high-density polyethylene (HDPE) implant widely used in craniofacial reconstruction, provides excellent mechanical strength but lacks bioactivity, limiting early cell adhesion, vascularization, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. To enhance Medpor® biointegration, we employed a multi-faceted modification strategy combining plasma treatment with biologically active components. Treated implants were coated with collagen and fibrin hydrogels and further supplemented with a platelet-derived Purified Exosome Product (PEP). Modified and control implants were evaluated in a subcutaneous mouse model to assess host tissue response, vascularization, and implant integration. Tissue ingrowth was observed in the pores of all Medpor® implants. Plasma treatment significantly increased the surface hydrophilicity of Medpor®, promoting host cell adhesion and tissue infiltration. Implants modified with both hydrogels and PEP exhibited enhanced ECM deposition, greater vascular density, and improved tissue integration compared to untreated Medpor®. The combination of physicochemical surface treatment and biochemical cues led to a synergistic effect, supporting tissue ingrowth and angiogenesis under a controlled host immune response. This study demonstrates that integrating plasma surface modification with bioactive hydrogels and PEP can effectively enhance the biointegration of Medpor® implants in vivo. The combined approach significantly enhances implant vascularization and ECM development, offering a promising translational strategy for improving synthetic implant performance in regenerative and reconstructive biomaterial applications.","","Ya","0.00","2212-5469","",""

However, the poor cell adhesiveness of PDMS limits its application as a stable substrate for long-term cell cultures. To address these challenges, we synthesized a photocrosslinkable terpolymer composed of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)acrylamide, N-benzophenone acrylamide, and N-succinimidyl acrylate (NSA), and covalently grafted it onto PDMS surfaces using UV irradiation. The ternary polymer coatings exhibited long-term stability in aqueous media and suppressed thenonspecific adsorption of proteins and cell adhesion. Furthermore, the immobilization of collagen on the side groups of NSA provides selective cell-adhesive functionality. In particular, PDMS surfaces modified with a ternary polymer containing 10 mol% NSA supported the robust and sustained adhesion of C2C12 myoblasts. When combined with stripe-patterned microstructures, these surfaces promoted unidirectional alignment, efficient myotube formation, and strong expression of dystrophin, with the 25 μm-pitch pattern demonstrating the most pronounced effects. Notably, spontaneous contraction of the formed myotubes confirmed advanced functional differentiation. These results demonstrate that the proposed facile and durable surface modification strategy for PDMS imparts both anti-biofouling properties and selective biofunctionality. The PDMS modification strategy provides a versatile platform for engineering functional muscle fibers and expanding the potential of PDMS-based bio-microdevices and tissue-engineered constructs.","","Parsial","0.00","2666-5344","21",""

A key challenge in developing these scaffolds is achieving sustained, localized delivery of osteoinductive drugs, which is crucial for enhancing bone tissue regeneration within the defect site. This research engineered a novel κ-carrageenan-based composite scaffold incorporating hydroxyapatite-coated chitosan nanoparticles for regulated rosuvastatin release. Chitosan nanoparticles containing rosuvastatin were synthesized using a water-in-oil emulsion method and subsequently coated with hydroxyapatite. κ-carrageenan-based scaffolds were then fabricated with varying concentrations of nanoparticles (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) and evaluated for their physical and mechanical properties. They were also assessed for biocompatibility, osteogenic differentiation potential, and hemocompatibility. Notably, the hydroxyapatite coating increased the size of nanoparticles and enabled a stable, long-term release of rosuvastatin. Moreover, incorporating these nanoparticles into scaffolds further enhanced the sustained release profile appropriate for long-term bone healing. Scaffolds containing 20% nanoparticles demonstrated the highest mechanical strength and were selected for cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation studies. Alkaline phosphatase activity and alizarin red staining confirmed the scaffolds' ability to promote osteogenic differentiation. Hemocompatibility assessment revealed a low hemolysis percentage (< 5%) for the carrageenan-based scaffolds, indicating good blood compatibility.

Here, arc-based direct energy deposition technology is introduced to fabricate 316 L SS via additive manufacturing (AM). The AM 316 L SS are subjected to metallurgical, mechanical, chemical, in vitro and in vivo analyses for their possible orthopedic applications. Compared to commercially available 316 L SS implant, the AM implants encompass γ-austenite phases with δ-ferrite structures that induce pinning dislocations, improve resistance to crack propagation and enhance mechanical performances. The evolution of δ-ferrite structures with higher inter-layer dwell times promotes Cr and Mo content, improving passive layer thickness and thereby enhancing the corrosion resistance, which prevents the release of toxic ions into the bloodstream and cellular metabolism. Additionally, improved BCI with less adherence and activation of platelets on the AM deposits indicates uninterrupted blood flow along the site of implantation and improved thrombo-resistance. The reduction in contact angle (highly hydrophilic) promotes the adsorption of body fluid and proteinaceous materials that boost the adhesion, proliferation, and cytoplasmic extension of cells (from in vitro), marrow spaces, collagen fibers, and tissue adherences (from in vivo). The AM implants do not show any acute toxicity in blood profiles and vital organs (liver and kidney) after long-term implantation in Wistar rats.

Tissue engineering seeks to improve repair using synthetic polymer scaffolds with biomimetic factors to enhance the regenerative potential. Methods: In this study, we compared three groups, namely, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) meltblown scaffolds, PLA meltblown scaffolds coated with tendon-derived matrix (TDM), and PLA meltblown scaffolds with carbodiimide crosslinked TDM (2.5:1:1 EDC:NHS:COOH ratio) (EDC-TDM) and determined their potential for engineered tendon development. We cultured human adipose stem cells (hASCs) for 28 days on meltblown scaffolds (n = 4-6/group) and measured tensile mechanical function, matrix synthesis, and matrix composition using biochemical assays and proteomics. Results: Coating PLA meltblown scaffolds with TDM improved yield stretch and stress at 28 days compared with PLA. Matrix synthesis rates for TDM or EDC-TDM were similar to PLA. Proteomic analysis revealed that hASCs produced a collagen-rich extracellular matrix, with many tendon-related matrix proteins. Coating scaffolds with TDM led to an increase in collagen type I whereas EDC-TDM scaffolds had an increase in glycoproteins and ECM regulators compared with other groups, consistent with increased maturity of the newly deposited matrix. Conclusions: TDM coating and crosslinking of meltblown scaffolds demonstrated matricellular benefits for the proteome of engineered tendon development but provided fewer clear benefits toward mechanical, biochemical, and rate of matrix accumulation than expected, and that previous work with electrospun scaffolds would suggest. However, electrospun scaffolds have different fiber structure and microarchitecture than meltblown, suggesting that further consideration of these differences and refinement of TDM application methods to meltblown scaffolds is required.","","Parsial","0.00","1932-7005","2025",""

Cellular activities such as proliferation, Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteogenic gene expression (runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), collagen type 1 (Col I), osteocalcin ( OCn), osteopontin (OP)), and mineralization were assessed. Von Kossa staining was performed to analyze mineralization, and the expression of cell adhesion proteins (N-cadherin (NC), integrin alpha V (IaV), integrin beta 3, (Ib3)) was measured. The results showed that approximately 50% of the VD released over 50 hours. The chitosan coating increased surface roughness three-fold, and this, combined with VD release, resulted in reduced cell proliferation but increased ALP activity, suggesting enhanced differentiation. VD-functionalized Ti surfaces showed statistically significant differences in osteogenic gene expressions, particularly on rougher surfaces. Additionally, the expression of cell adhesion proteins (NC, IaV, Ib3) was upregulated on VD-containing coated surfaces. Von Kossa analysis revealed that surface roughness significantly enhanced mineralization, particularly on VD-free surfaces by day 7, while mineralization on VD-containing bare surfaces started on day 14. These findings demonstrate that VD-loaded chitosan coatings significantly enhance the biocompatibility and bioactivity of Ti-based materials, highlighting their potential for applications in bone regeneration.","","Parsial","0.00","1573-9686","53","4"

Notably, the nanotopographical architectures found in natural materials have been leveraged in biomaterial design to enhance cell adhesion and proliferation and improve tissue regeneration for biomedical applications. In this study, we fabricated three-dimensional (3D) chitin-glucan micro/nanofibrous fungal-based spheres coated with collagen (type I) to mimic the native extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment. These collagen-coated fungal nano/microfibrous spheres (C-FNS) were utilized to construct 3D scaffolded spheroids of human fibroblasts through suspension culture for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The particle sizes of C-FNS ranged from 1.4 to 3.25 µm (average: 2.27 ± 0.38 µm), with a porosity of 81.17 %. Field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) revealed that C-FNS comprised continuous chitin-glucan fibers with an average diameter of 363 ± 61 nm (range: 203-512 nm), exhibiting a highly interconnected structure. The reduced arithmetic average roughness (Ra) and root mean square roughness (Rq) values of C-FNS compared to uncoated FNS suggested that collagen coating reduced surface roughness, resulting in a smoother surface that enhanced hydrophilicity, crucial for mammalian cell adhesion and spheroid formation. Moreover, the in vitro cytocompatibility of C-FNS with fibroblasts was evaluated using a resazurin-based PrestoBlue assay, which demonstrated a time-dependent increase in the metabolic activity of C-FNS/fibroblast spheroids during suspension culture for up to 14 days. FE-SEM images of C-FNS/fibroblast spheroids further revealed enhanced adhesion and proliferation of fibroblasts on the nano/microfibrous mycelial architecture, accompanied by the secretion of ECM components and formation of multilayered cell sheets over the 14-day culture period. Similarly, an assessment of the hemocompatibility of C-FNS with erythrocytes revealed the non-hemolytic properties of the biomaterial. Overall, the interaction between collagen-coated fungal chitin-glucan nano/microfibrous structures and mammalian cells holds significant potential for the development of novel, sustainable biomaterials with tailored properties for a myriad of biomedical applications, including tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, drug screening, and wound healing.","","Parsial","0.00","1532-3072","93",""

Titanium disks were prepared with a sandblasted, large grit and acid-etched (SLA) surface. EPD was employed to deposit collagen type I onto the titanium surfaces, followed by two modes of mineralization: extra-fibril mineralization (EFM) and inter-fibril mineralization (IFM). Then comprehensive in vitro studies were conducted including surface properties, cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and inflammatory responses. EPD successfully deposited a uniform collagen layer on titanium surfaces. EFM resulted in deposition of larger, irregularly shaped crystals, while IFM produced controlled, helical fibril mineralization. IFM-treated surfaces exhibited enhanced cell viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. Both EFM and IFM surfaces triggered higher macrophage activation than SLA surfaces. While EFM primarily induced a stronger M1 pro-inflammatory response, IFM exhibited a more balanced macrophage polarization with upregulated M2 markers at later stages. EPD, particularly when integrated with IFM, significantly enhances the bioactivity and osteogenic potential of collagen-coated titanium implants. This method surpasses traditional SLA surfaces by stabilizing the collagen layer and creating a biomimetic environment conducive to bone regeneration and healing through a balanced inflammatory response, offering a promising strategy to improve titanium implant performance.","","Parsial","0.00","2772-9508","167",""

This study aims to address these challenges by investigating bacterial cellulose (BC) as a promising material for CCS. Variability in patch quality from previous studies was addressed by refining the production protocol taking advantage of optical density (OD) measurements. After a 72 h incubation, patches were harvested and tested mechanically with burst pressure and uniaxial strain testing. BC's biomechanical properties were further explored by modifying nutrient concentrations, creating different media groups (N10, N30, N50). Hybrid patches combining BC with electrospun polyurethane (ESP-PU) were developed using a specially designed 3D-printed flask to ensure uniform coating and integration. The initial bacterial concentration significantly influenced cellulose yield and growth rate, with static cultures outperforming shaken ones. Nutrient-enriched media (N10, N30, N50) produced cellulose with greater elasticity and strength compared to standard C-Medium, with stiffness correlating to nutrient concentration. Inflation tests showed that N10 and N30 samples withstood higher pressures than N50, which, despite being stiffer, performed worse under rapid inflation. All samples, however, maintained pressures above physiological levels. Scanning electron microscopy analysis confirmed effective BC coating of PU fibres without altering BC fibre orientation or bacterial activity. BC patches demonstrated burst pressure resistance above 1,400 mmHg.

However, the complex components and mechanisms of these coatings have limited both the exploration of cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction and potential clinical applications. In this study, we identified eight pure synthetic integrin-binding short peptides as effective coatings for iPSC growth and AFE generation with an integrin-binding peptide array. Our results showed that integrinα5β1-,αVβ8-, andαIIbβ3-binding peptides supported the adhesion and expansion of iPSCs and AFE generation by guided differentiation via a definitive endoderm (DE) in a full-anchorage-dependent manner. AFE generation was also found on coatings based on integrinα3β1-,α6β1-,αVβ1-,αVβ6-, andαMβ2-binding peptides following a process with temporal suspension growth in the DE-inducing stage, with lower AFE generation efficiency compared to the full-anchorage-dependent peptide groups and Matrigel. According to the results, the integrinα5β1-binding peptide is the most promising defined substrate for inducing AFEs because of its equivalent efficiency with traditional Matrigel coating in supporting iPSC expansion and differentiation toward AFEs. Additionally, the other seven peptide-based coatings also exhibit potential and could be further investigated for developing synthetic-coating strategies in future studies involving AFEs.

Direct measurement of these microenvironmental forces has been challenging, particularly for cell-dense models. To address this, we previously developed hydrogel-based force sensors that are approximately the size of a cell and can be imaged over time to computationally assess the forces exerted by surrounding cells and matrix. The goal of this project was to identify how the physical characteristics of force sensors impact measurements. Sensors were varied in size, elastic modulus, and surface coating before being included in stem cell suspensions that then spontaneously self-assembled into spheroidal neotissues. Using this model of early mesenchymal condensation, we hypothesized that larger, softer sensors would provide greater sensitivity and precision, whereas protein coatings would influence the directionality of applied forces (tensile vs. compressive). These experiments were conducted using a high-content imaging system that allowed analysis of over a thousand sensors to evaluate the various conditions. Results indicated that measurement fidelity was highest for force sensors that had a diameter >20 µm and modulus ∼0.2 kPa. Extremely soft sensors deformed too much, whereas stiffer sensors deformed too little. Collagen and N-cadherin coatings, which replicated cell-matrix or cell-cell binding, respectively, allowed for tensile forces to be exerted on the sensors, with greater forces being observed for N-cadherin sensors in these highly cellular neotissue constructs. Uncoated sensors were universally compressed due to the lack of cell-sensor adhesion. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton lessened microenvironmental forces, whereas disruption of microtubules had no measurable effect.

In this study, three-dimensional (3D) polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds coated with collagen (Col) were fabricated by extrusion-based printing. The scaffolds were further functionalized with human endometrial mesenchymal stem cells (hEnMSCs) and osteoblast-derived exosomes (ODExo), obtained from osteoblast-like cells, to investigate their potential in bone regeneration. The printed scaffolds exhibited controlled porosity, suitable mechanical integrity, and improved hydrophilicity following collagen coating. ODExo were isolated from osteoblast-like cells and confirmed by morphology and particle size. In vitro analyses revealed that exosome-functionalized scaffolds significantly enhanced cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of hEnMSCs, as indicated by increased calcium deposition and elevated expression of osteogenic markers such as alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, RUNX2, and osteonectin, even without osteogenic induction medium. In vivo experiments using a rat calvarial defect model demonstrated superior bone formation and matrix mineralization in scaffolds containing exosomes compared with control groups. Moreover, transplantation of PCL/Col scaffolds seeded with hEnMSCs and ODExo implants further promoted bone regeneration in vivo. These findings demonstrate that osteoblast-derived exosomes serve as potent bioactive modulators capable of driving osteogenic differentiation and accelerating bone regeneration. Incorporating exosomes into 3D printed PCL/Col scaffolds provides a promising biomimetic and partially cell-free approach for the treatment of critical-sized bone defects. This strategy highlights the potential of combining advanced scaffold fabrication with bioactive vesicles to improve clinical outcomes in regenerative medicine.","","Parsial","0.00","1754-1611","19","1"

Matrix stiffness can significantly regulate the stem cell differentiation and bone repair. It is particularly important to develop dynamic stiffness scaffolds to simulate dynamic mechanical microenvironment for bone repair. This study proposed a novel method to achieve dynamic improvement of scaffold stiffness by mineralization, which is a natural process of bone matrix dynamic stiffening. The decalcified bone matrix (DBM)/collagen (Col)/silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite (SiHA) scaffold was constructed by coating the Col/SiHA on the surface of DBM. When the scaffolds contacted with body fluid, the stiffness of scaffolds were enhanced by mineralization, increasing from 9.10 ± 4.42 kPa to 19.77 ± 9.66 kPa in the DBM/Col scaffold and from 40.54 ± 6.25 kPa to 69.40 ± 8.76 kPa in the DBM/Col/SiHA scaffold. The experimental results proved that the DBM/Col/SiHA scaffold with dynamic stiffness had good biocompatibility and could promote the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cell. The DBM/Col/SiHA scaffold, when implanted in a rat calvarial defect model, further enhanced bone regeneration and integration, as evidenced by a bone mineral density reaching 285.592 ± 19.611 mg HA ccm-1at 12 weeks.

This study is the first to investigate the role of incorporated manganese-doped hydroxyapatite (Mn-HA) and gelatin coating in increased bioactivity and biological properties, specifically the cell attachment potencies of three-dimensional (3D) porous electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL). In this context, novel 3D porous composite scaffolds were synthesized by wet electrospinning of PCL incorporated with Mn-HA. The scaffolds were then coated with a thin gelatin layer to enhance the cell adhesion capacity. The effects of Mn-HA and the gelatin coating were evaluated in terms of structural, physicochemical, and biological properties. The results demonstrated that Mn-HA was successfully synthesized with doping of 2 mol% Mn, with MnSO4(manganese sulfate) and MnCl2(manganese chloride) precursors. Mn-HA powder with a MnSO4precursor indicated better cell viability results. Therefore, Mn-HA/PCL scaffolds with 2.5% and 5% (w/w) bioceramic content were prepared with the MnSO4precursor. The scaffolds' porosity increased from 24% (PCL/gelatin group) to approximately 34% in both the 2.5% and 5% (w/w) bioceramic-containing groups. The addition of Mn-HA powder improved thein vitrobioactivity and degradation rate of the scaffolds. Specifically, the 5% and 2.5% (w/w) Mn-HA incorporated scaffolds indicated 40% and 30% weight loss after 21 d of incubation, respectively. In contrast to the PCL/gelatin and HA-containing groups, the Mn-doped HA containing scaffolds exhibited a weight loss of around 17%-20%, indicating a decrease in degradation. The presence of the Mn-HA powder and gelatin coating elevated the cell viability results significantly, as opposed to the PCL scaffolds. Incorporation of 5% (w/w) Mn-HA improved the alkaline phosphatase activity and intracellular calcium levels, contrary to other groups. Thus, the incorporation of Mn-doped HA and gelatin into the PCL scaffold supports the potency towards properties required for BTE applications and suggests it as a prospective biomaterial for further evaluations.","","Parsial","0.00","1748-605X","21","1"

Due to the weak regeneration ability of chondrocytes and the complex structure of the bone-cartilage junction, there is currently no excellent repair method. The challenge of hyaline cartilage repair is to avoid fibrosis and hypertrophy, which has been solved to some extent after the advent of type II collagen scaffolds; the difficulty of the subchondral bone plate and cancellous bone repair lies in the repair of the complex transition structure of cartilage tidemark, calcified cartilage, subchondral bone plate, and cancellous bone. Inspired by developmental biology, the generation of this complex structure during development depends on endochondral ossification (ECO). ECO depends on some specific proteins, such as IHH, PTHrP, BMP, and WNT, and the receptors of these proteins. Studies have shown that polydopamine coating can promote the production of BMP and WNT proteins. We developed a type II collagen-based double-layer scaffold (Col II & Dopa-Col II) with type II collagen on the upper layer and polydopamine-coated type II collagen on the lower layer. Proteomics and RNA sequencing analysis have found that polydopamine coating can mobilize the proliferation and hypertrophy differentiation of chondrocytes, induce intra-chondral vascular nerve invasion, and promote ECO and bone remodeling by upregulating Parathyroid hormone signaling pathway, Hedgehog signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, and Axon guidance.

Existing treatment options, including autologous, allogeneic, and xenogeneic skin grafts, are constrained by donor scarcity, low graft survival rates, scarring, flap edema, and the inability to regenerate skin appendages. Consequently, the development of tissue-engineered skin substitutes comprising scaffolds, cells, and bioactive factors has emerged as a promising approach for repairing extensive skin defects. Herein, we optimized the electrospinning technique to construct a three-dimensional polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber scaffold with a thickness of 5 μm ± 0.7 μm and a porosity of 85%. Dopamine self-polymerization was employed to form a polydopamine (PDA) coating, which was subsequently combined with type I collagen (COL) to produce a polycaprolactone-polydopamine-collagen (PPC) scaffold. The PPC scaffold demonstrated significantly enhanced mechanical strength and hydrophilicity, along with excellent biocompatibility. The biocompatibility of the PPC nanofiber scaffold was markedly improved, effectively promoting the migration, adhesion, and proliferation of keratinocytes (KCs). Co-culturing autologous KCs with the PPC scaffold to construct an epidermal membrane graft significantly accelerated wound healing, resulting in a more complete neo-skin tissue structure and improved wound healing quality. Moreover, qPCR and Western blot analyses were employed to assess key protein and gene expression levels in the Wnt signaling pathway, revealing that our epidermal cell membrane could activate the Wnt signaling pathway, thereby promoting wound healing.

The physical and biological properties of these samples were evaluated to find the optimum conditions for a biphasic scaffold. Modification of both cartilage and bone scaffolds resulted in a smaller pore size, lower swelling rate, and higher rigidity. Gelatin significantly promoted cartilage biomarker production and agarose facilitated cell proliferation, inducing a homogeneous cell distribution and stimulating chondrogenesis. Furthermore, modification with mineralized collagen decreased cell proliferation in osteoblast progenitors but enhanced differentiation into osteoblasts.

The aim of this study was to analyze the suitability of LCM and ACM alone or coated with heparin (the latter are abbreviated as LCMH and ACMH, respectively) as implant material for cartilage repair. Therefore, mesenchymal stem cells were chondrogenically differentiated in 2D cultures with polymer discs. Differentiation was induced by the supplementation of cell medium with dimethyloxalylglycine, TGF-β, and BMP2. After 5 days, no increase in proinflammatory factors was observed. Cell viability declined on ACM and ACMH discs. During early chondrogenesis, SOX9 expression increased on LCM and LCMH discs, while TRPV4 expression decreased on ACMH discs. At day 20, the level of collagen type II increased on LCM, LCMH, and ACM discs, demonstrating the ability of chondrogenic development on these implants. In summary, coating with heparin showed no advantages compared to pure LCM and ACM.

The novelty of this study is based on the combination of the argon plasma exposure of a micropatterned PDMS scaffold, where the plasma served as a strong tool for subsequent grafting of collagen coatings and their application as cell growth scaffolds, where the standard was significantly exceeded. As part of the scaffold design, templates with a patterned microstructure of different dimensions (50 × 50, 50 × 20, and 30 × 30 μm2) were created by photolithography followed by pattern replication on a PDMS polymer substrate. Subsequently, the prepared microstructured PDMS replicas were coated with a type I collagen layer. The sample preparation was followed by the characterization of material surface properties using various analytical techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). To evaluate the biocompatibility of the produced samples, we conducted studies on the interactions between selected polymer replicas and micro- and nanostructures and mammalian cells. Specifically, we utilized mouse myoblasts (C2C12), and our results demonstrate that we achieved excellent cell alignment in conjunction with the development of a cytocompatible surface. Consequently, the outcomes of this research contribute to an enhanced comprehension of surface properties and interactions between structured polymers and mammalian cells. The use of periodic microstructures has the potential to advance the creation of novel materials and scaffolds in tissue engineering. These materials exhibit exceptional biocompatibility and possess the capacity to promote cell adhesion and growth.","","Parsial","0.00","1422-0067","25","5"

The physicochemical characteristics of the developed bone graft material were verified through field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), brunauer emmett teller (BET), attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), and water absorption test. Subsequently, the biocompatibility and bone healing effects were assessed using a rat calvarial defect model. The physicochemical test results confirmed that collagen coating increased bone graft materials' surface roughness and fluid absorption but did not affect their porous structure. In vivo evaluations revealed that collagen coating had no adverse impact on the bone healing effect of bone graft materials. After confirming the biocompatibility and effectiveness, we applied the bone graft materials in two orthopedic cases and one dental case. Notably, successful fracture healing was observed in both orthopedic cases. In the dental case, successful bone regeneration was achieved without any loss of alveolar bone. This study demonstrated that porcine bone graft material promotes bone healing in dogs with its hemostatic and cohesive effects resulting from the collagen coating. Bone graft materials with enhanced biocompatibility through collagen coating are expected to be widely used in veterinary clinical practice.","","Parsial","0.00","2297-1769","11",""

Morphological analysis indicated a homogeneous coating of the β-LG layer on the surface of network-like scaffolds. The β-LG-coated scaffolds exhibited improved swelling capacity as a function of the β-LG concentration. Compared to ADA-GEL/PDA scaffolds, the β-LG-coated scaffolds demonstrated delayed degradation and enhanced biomineralization.

The dpDTM was modified into two protocols: Acid-modified dpDTM (A-dpDTM) and collagen-modified dpDTM (C-dpDTM). Results demonstrated that A-dpDTM and C-dpDTM had increased pore sizes and rougher surfaces compared to dpDTM. Collagen immobilization was evidenced by nitrogen presence exclusively in C-dpDTM. All groups had a Ca/P molar ratio of 1.67 and hydroxyapatite as the sole constituent, with 65-67% crystallinity. Degradation rates significantly increased to 30% and 20% for C-dpDTM and A-dpDTM, respectively, compared to 10% for dpDTM after 120 days. Cumulative collagen release of C-dpDTM on Day 30 was 45.16 µg/ml. Osteoblasts attachment and proliferation were enhanced on all scaffolds, especially C-dpDTM, which displayed the highest proliferation and differentiation rates.

In addition, coating of PLLA-reconstructed vessels with rat tail collagen favored perivascular attachment and survival of MSC-like cells (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), confirming its potentiality as a perivascular stroma for triggering competence of seeded MSCs.

In the present study, coating layers consisting of fluoride-incorporated apatite (FAp) crystals with immobilized bFGF were coated on a porous collagen sponge by a precursor-assisted biomimetic process using supersaturated calcium phosphate solutions with various fluoride concentrations. The fluoride content in the coating layer increased with the increasing fluoride concentration of the supersaturated solution. The increased fluoride content in the coating layer reduced its solubility and suppressed the burst release of bFGF from the coated sponge into a physiological salt solution.

The slow and sustained release of Mg2+ during the degradation process activated extracellular matrix proteins for bone regeneration, accelerating osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). The extract solutions of Mg-MAO/DCPD considerably promoted the activation of the Wnt and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Furthermore, the evaluation of the rat skull defect model manifested the outstanding bone-healing efficiency of the Mg-MAO/DCPD membrane. Taken together, the Mg-MAO/DCPD membrane demonstrates an optimized degradation rate and excellent bioactivity and is believed to have great application prospects in bone tissue engineering.","","Ya","0.00","2373-9878","10","2"

A representative spinal fusion material, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), is advantageous in this regard as it can work in close proximity to the elastic modulus of cancellous bone. However, if it is used without surface modification, the initial osseointegration will be low due to lack of bioactivity, resulting in limitations in surgical treatment. In this study, we aimed to modify the surface of PEEK cages to a hydrophilic surface by coating with polyethylene glycol (PEG), hyaluronic acid (HA), and polydopamine (PDA), and to analyze whether the coated surface exhibits improved bioactivity and changes in mechanical properties for orthopedic applications. Material properties of coated samples were characterized and compared with various PEEK groups, including PEEK, PEEK-PEG, PEEK-HA, and PEEK-PDA. In an in vitro study, cell proliferation was found to be enhanced on PDA-coated PEEK; it was approximately twice as high compared to the control group. In addition, mechanical properties, including static and torsion, were not affected by the presence of the coating. Thus, the results suggest that PEEK-PDA may have the potential for clinical application in fusion surgery for spinal diseases, as it may improve the rate of osseointegration.","","Ya","0.00","2306-5354","11","4"

Guided tissue regeneration (GTR) using barrier membranes for alveolar bone repair is a common clinical treatment. However, most commercially available collagen barrier membranes are expensive and lack the antibacterial properties essential for effective bone regeneration. Herein, we report a natural polysaccharide chitin hydrogel barrier membrane with a Janus structure (ChT-PDA-p-HAP), featuring high antibacterial and protein-repelling activity on the outer side and good osteogenesis ability on the inner side. This multifunctional membrane is fabricated though a three-step process: (i) dissolution and regeneration of chitin, (ii) co-deposition with polydopamine (PDA) and poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (pSBMA), and (iii) coating with gelatin-hydroxyapatite (gelatin-HAP). In vitro cell experiments demonstrated the membrane's high biocompatibility and significant osteogenic activity. In vivo implantation in rats with periodontal defects revealed that the cemento-enamel junction index of the ChT-PDA-p-HAP membrane (1.165 mm) was superior to that of the commercial Bio-Gide® membrane (1.350 mm). This work presents a method for fabricating a chitin-based Janus barrier membrane, potentially expanding the use of chitin in tissue engineering. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study introduces a Janus hydrogel membrane based on chitin, tailored for guided tissue regeneration in periodontal defects. By combining antibacterial properties and osteogenic capabilities in a single membrane, the ChT-PDA-p-HAP membrane represents a significant advancement over traditional collagen barriers. Its outer surface, enhanced by Cu2+ and PDA-pSBMA coatings, resists bacterial colonization and protein adhesion effectively, while the inner side, coated with gelatin-HAP, promotes robust bone formation. In vitro experiments demonstrate high biocompatibility and substantial osteogenic differentiation, while in vivo testing in rat models confirms good therapeutic efficacy compared to commercial membranes. This multifunctional approach not only utilizes chitin's abundant natural resource but also integrates simple coating techniques to enhance therapeutic outcomes in periodontal tissue engineering, offering promising avenues for broader biomedical applications.","","Parsial","0.00","1878-7568","190",""

Traditional animal models, while useful, do not fully capture the intricacies of human kidney physiology and pathophysiology. Tissue engineering offers a promising solution, yet current models often fall short in replicating the complex microarchitecture and biochemical milieu of the kidney. To address this challenge, we propose the development of a sophisticated in vitro glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) utilizing advanced biomaterials and a kidney decellularized extracellular matrix (kdECM). In our approach, we employ a bacterial cellulose membrane (BC) as a scaffold, providing a robust framework for cell growth and interaction. Coating this scaffold with kdECM hydrogel derived from caprine kidney tissue via a detergent-free decellularization method ensures the preservation of vital extracellular matrix proteins crucial for cellular compatibility and signaling. Our engineered GFB not only supports the growth of endothelial and podocyte cells but also exhibits the presence of key markers such as CD31 and nephrin, indicating successful cellular integration. Furthermore, the expression of collagen IV, an essential extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, validates the fidelity of our model in simulating cellular interactions within a kdECM matrix. Additionally, we assessed the filtration efficiency of the developed GFB model using albumin, a standard protein, to evaluate its performance under conditions that closely mimic the native physiological environment. This innovative approach, which faithfully recapitulates the native microenvironment of the glomerulus, holds immense promise for elucidating kidney disease mechanisms, conducting permeability studies, and advancing personalized therapeutic strategies. By leveraging cutting-edge biomaterials and tissue-specific coculture technology, this study can be further extended to develop GFB for the treatment of renal diseases, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.","","Parsial","0.00","1944-8252","16","39"

Implant-associated infection, however, remains a major clinical challenge. Silver-based implant coatings can potentially reduce bacterial growth and inhibit biofilm formation, thereby reducing the risk of periprosthetic infections. In the current study, a 1-µm thick silver coating was prepared on the surface of a 3D-printed microporous titanium alloy with physical vapor deposition (PVD), with a final silver content of 1.00 ± 02 mg/cm2. Cell viability was evaluated with an MTT assay of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and human dermal fibroblasts cultured on the surface of the implants, and showed low cytotoxicity for cells during the 14-day follow-up period. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of the relative gene expression of the extracellular matrix components (fibronectin, vitronectin, type I collagen) and cell adhesion markers (α2, α5, αV, β1 integrins) in dermal fibroblasts showed that cell adhesion was not reduced by the silver coating of the microporous implants. An RT-PCR analysis of gene expression related to osteogenic differentiation, including TGF-β1, SMAD4, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and osteonectin in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, demonstrated that silver coating did not reduce the osteogenic activity of cells and, to the contrary, enhanced the activity of the TGF-β signaling pathway.

Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys are being explored as a biomaterial for degradable implants due to mechanical properties similar to those of bone. Previous in vitro studies have determined the degradation rate of pure Mg to be relatively fast when compared to bone regeneration. Hydroxyapatite (HA), the mineral component of bone, may serve as a surface coating on Mg-based implants to effectively slow and control the degradation rate. The objective of this work was to develop and implement a finite element (FE) model that utilizes a damage evolution law for pitting corrosion to predict the degradation of pure Mg (non-coated) and HA-coated pure Mg (coated) materials simulated in physiological conditions. Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed on a cylindrical Mg specimen (25.4 mm diameter, 8 mm height) through Abaqus/Standard software to incrementally monitor the damage value of each Mg element and subsequently delete fully-degraded elements from the simulation. A Fortran user-material (UMAT) subroutine assigned each element a pitting parameter, controlling the rate of degradation throughout the simulation and providing necessary inputs of elastic material properties and degradation model parameters for pure Mg and HA into Abaqus. The simulations allowed for the visualization of both pure Mg and HA-coated pure Mg degradation over a 120-day period, displaying expected degradation trends such as lower corrosion rates for HA-coated Mg and degradation propagating from the edges inward. Simulation results were calibrated with our prior results from a 30-day experimental degradation study via direct comparison with mass loss over time. Additionally, lower length scale, density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed to provide physical meaning for the model pitting parameter. The FE simulation was extended to model resin-enclosed pure Mg and HA-coated pure Mg degradation, where only the top surface of the specimen was exposed to the corrosion surface, for investigating changes in Mg surface roughness (height) over time. The impacts of this work include the establishment of a computational model of pure Mg and HA-coated pure Mg degradation calibrated using in vitro degradation data to advance the use of Mg-based biomaterials, and more broadly, to predict degradation rates of next-generation orthopedic implants.","","Parsial","0.00","1552-4981","112","12"

This has been inspired by the characteristics of the cells' microenvironment where signalling is supported by electrical stimulation. Numerous studies have demonstrated the positive influence of electrical stimulation on cell excitation to proliferate, differentiate, and deposit extracellular matrix. Even without external electrical stimulation, research shows that electrically active scaffolds can improve tissue regeneration capacity. Tissues like bone, muscle, and neural contain electrically excitable cells that respond to electrical cues provided by implanted biomaterials. To introduce an electrical pathway, TE scaffolds can incorporate conductive polymers, metallic nanoparticles, and ceramic nanostructures. However, these materials often do not meet implantation criteria, such as maintaining mechanical durability and degradation characteristics, making them unsuitable as scaffold matrices. Instead, depositing conductive layers on TE scaffolds has shown promise as an efficient alternative to creating electrically conductive structures. A stratified scaffold with an electroactive surface synergistically excites the cells through active top-pathway, with/without electrical stimulation, providing an ideal matrix for cell growth, proliferation, and tissue deposition. Additionally, these conductive coatings can be enriched with bioactive or pharmaceutical components to enhance the scaffold's biomedical performance. This review covers recent developments in electrically active biomedical coatings for TE. The physicochemical and biological properties of conductive coating materials, including polymers (polypyrrole, polyaniline and PEDOT:PSS), metallic nanoparticles (gold, silver) and inorganic (ceramic) particles (carbon nanotubes, graphene-based materials and Mxenes) are examined.

Specifically, eco-friendly and biocompatible collagen extracted from grass carp fish scales was co-electrospun with CS to produce a biomimetic extracellular matrix membrane. An enhanced biomimetic mineralized HAp coating provided abundant active calcium and phosphate sites, which promoted cell osteogenic differentiation, and showed greater in vivo absorption.

The ability to reliably create spatially controlled areas of mineralization in composite engineered tissues is of growing interest in the field, and the use of HA-functionalized biomaterials may provide a robust solution to this challenge. In this study, we successfully fabricated polycaprolactone salt-leached scaffolds with two levels of a biomimetic calcium phosphate coating to examine their effects on MSC osteogenesis. Longer duration coating in simulated body fluid (SBF) led to increased HA crystal nucleation within scaffold interiors as well as more robust HA crystal formation on scaffold surfaces. Ultimately, the increased surface stiffness of scaffolds coated in SBF for 7 days in comparison to scaffolds coated in SBF for 1 day led to more robust osteogenesis of MSCs in vitro without the assistance of osteogenic signaling molecules. This study also demonstrated that the use of SBF-based HA coatings can promote higher levels of osteogenesis in vivo. Finally, when incorporated as the endplate region of a larger tissue-engineered intervertebral disc replacement, HA coating did not induce mineralization in or promote cell migration out of neighboring biomaterials.

Chitosan was employed owing to its antibacterial activity and also its ability to promote cell adhesion and proliferation favorable for tissue engineering and regeneration purposes. Moreover, the Ch film can be additionally modified with other substances of biological importance (DOPC, CsA and LG). The layers of varying compositions were prepared using the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique on the air plasma-activated PET support.

The obtained results show clearly the dependence of the surface properties of the films on the molar ratio of components and allow for a better understanding of the coating organization and mechanisms of interactions at the molecular level both inside the films and between the films and the polar/apolar liquids imitating the environment of different properties. The organized layers of this type can be helpful in gaining control over the surface properties of the biomaterial, thus getting rid of the limitations in favor of increased biocompatibility.

This paper is a narrative review of the materials used for scaffold fabrication by 3D printing. We have also reviewed two types of scaffolds that we designed and fabricated. Poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffolds were printed using fused deposition modelling technology. Collagen-based scaffolds were printed using a bioprinting technique. These scaffolds were tested for their physical properties and biocompatibility. Work in the emerging field of 3D-printed scaffolds for bone repair is briefly reviewed. Our work provides an example of PLLA scaffolds that were successfully 3D-printed with optimal porosity, pore size and fibre thickness. The compressive modulus was similar to, or better than, the trabecular bone of the mandible. PLLA scaffolds generated an electric potential upon cyclic/repeated loading. The crystallinity was reduced during the 3D printing. The hydrolytic degradation was relatively slow. Osteoblast-like cells did not attach to uncoated scaffolds but attached well and proliferated after coating the scaffold with fibrinogen. Collagen-based bio-ink scaffolds were also printed successfully. Osteoclast-like cells adhered, differentiated, and survived well on the scaffold. Efforts are underway to identify means to improve the structural stability of the collagen-based scaffolds, perhaps through mineralization by the polymer-induced liquid precursor process. 3D-printing technology is promising for constructing next-generation bone regeneration scaffolds. We describe our efforts to test PLLA and collagen scaffolds produced by 3D printing. The 3D-printed PLLA scaffolds showed promising properties akin to natural bone. Collagen scaffolds need further work to improve structural integrity. Ideally, such biological scaffolds will be mineralized to produce true bone biomimetics.

During OA progression, the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the cartilage is aberrantly remodeled by chondrocytes. Chondrocytes, being the main cell population of the cartilage, participate in cartilage regeneration process. To this end, modern tissue engineering strategies involve the recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) due to their regenerative capacity as to promote chondrocyte self-regeneration. In the present study, we evaluated the role of type II collagen, as the main matrix macromolecule in the cartilage matrix, to promote chondrogenic differentiation in two MSC in vitro culture systems. The chondrogenic differentiation of human Wharton's jelly- and dental pulp-derived MSCs was investigated over a 24-day culture period on type II collagen coating to improve the binding affinity of MSCs. Functional assays, demonstrated that type II collagen promoted chondrogenic differentiation in both MSCs tested, which was confirmed through gene and protein analysis of major chondrogenic markers.

In this study, a magnetic polyurethane (PU)-2205 stainless steel (2205-SS) nanofibrous composite biomaterial was developed through analysis of composite sheets and application to stent-grafts. The PU nanofibers provide strength and elasticity while the 2205-SS microparticles provide ferromagnetic properties.

The structural feature of the glasses, assessed by XRD and FTIR, did not change in spite of Nb2O5 incorporation. The Raman spectra reveal the Nb2O5 incorporation related to the appearance of NbO4 and NbO6 structural units. Since the electrical characteristics of these biomaterials influence their osseointegration ability, AC and DC electrical conductivity were studied by impedance spectroscopy, in the frequency range of 102-106 Hz and temperature range of 200-400 K.

Additionally, many bioengineering and culture methods fail to maintain the chondrocyte phenotype and contain the correct matrix composition in the long term. Existing cartilage-engineering approaches have been developed, but many approaches involve complicated culture techniques and require foreign substances and biomaterials as scaffolds. While these scaffold-based approaches have numerous advantages, such as an instant or rapid creation of biomechanical properties, they frequently result in dedifferentiation of cells in part, due to the adherence to foreign scaffold materials. In this chapter, we describe a novel approach of developing a scaffold-less cartilage-like biomaterial, using the simple principle that cells at high density bear a capacity to coalesce when they cannot attach to any culture substrate. We refer to the biomaterial formed as a cartilage tissue equivalent or CTA and have published to describe their characteristics and utility in high-throughput drug screening.

We have demonstrated that this approach can rapidly form biomass of chondrocytes that over time becomes very synthetically active producing a cartilage-like extracellular matrix that closely mimics the biochemical and biomechanical characteristics of native articular cartilage. The culture approach can also be used to form CTA from other than articular cartilage-derived chondrocytes as well as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (while differentiating MSCs into chondrocytes).

Decellularisation was carried out on bone (B-ECM), liver (LIV-ECM), and small intestinal (SIS-ECM) tissues and the resultant dECM was biochemically and mechanically characterised. dECMh differed in mechanical and biochemical properties that likely had an effect on Schwann cell behaviour observed in metabolic activity and contraction profiles. Cellular alignment was observed in tethered moulds within the B-ECM and SIS-ECM derived hydrogels only. No difference was observed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurite extension between the dECMh groups and collagen I groups when applied as a coverslip coating, however, when DRG were seeded atop EngNT constructs, only the B-ECM derived EngNT performed similarly to collagen I derived EngNT. B-ECM EngNT further exhibited similar axonal regeneration to collagen I EngNT in a 10 mm gap rat sciatic nerve injury model after 4 weeks.

Nowadays, various techniques have been developed for the applications of SF in bioengineering. Most of the literature reviews focus on the SF-based biomaterials and their different forms of applications such as films, hydrogels, and scaffolds. SF is also valuable as a coating on other substrate materials for biomedicine; however, there are few reviews related to SF-coated biomaterials. Thus, in this review, we focused on the surface modification of biomaterials using SF coatings, demonstrated their various preparation methods on substrate materials, and introduced the latest procedures. The diverse applications of SF coatings for biomedicine are discussed, including bone, ligament, skin, mucosa, and nerve regeneration, and dental implant surface modification. SF coating is conducive to inducing cell adhesion and migration, promoting hydroxyapatite (HA) deposition and matrix mineralization, and inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway, making it a promising strategy for bone regeneration. In addition, SF-coated composite scaffolds can be considered prospective candidates for ligament regeneration after injury. SF coating has been proven to enhance the mechanical properties of the substrate material, and render integral stability to the dressing material during the regeneration of skin and mucosa. Moreover, SF coating is a potential strategy to accelerate nerve regeneration due to its dielectric properties, mechanical flexibility, and angiogenesis promotion effect. In addition, SF coating is an effective and popular means for dental implant surface modification to promote osteogenesis around implants made of different materials.

The use of ceramic particles is a generally preferred option to increase the osteoconductivity of the base material, while acting as buffers to maintain the pH level of the surroundings tissues. Surface modification is another approach to overcome the limitations of PLA for tissue engineering applications. In this work, the degradation profile of 3D-printed PLA scaffolds containing beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3 ) particles has been studied under hydrolytic conditions. Composite samples treated with plasma and coated with Aloe vera extracts were also studied to evaluate the effect of this surface modification method. The characterization of the 3D structures included its morphological, calorimetric and mechanical evaluation. According to the results obtained, the proposed composite scaffolds allowed an adequate maintenance of the pH level of the surrounding medium, with no effects observed on the morphology and mechanical properties of these structures. Hence, these samples showed potential to be further investigated as candidates for bone tissue regeneration.","","Ya","0.00","1552-4981","111","2"

In this study, a cartilage-biomimetic silk fibroin (SF)-based scaffold with controlled sequential release of two bioactive molecules is developed. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is initially loaded onto the SF scaffolds by physical absorption, which are then successively functionalized with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-specific-affinity peptide (E7) via gradient degradation coating of Silk fibroin Methacryloyl (SilMA)/Hyaluronic acid Methacryloyl (HAMA). Such SF-based scaffolds exhibit excellent structural stability and catilage-like mechanical properties, thus providing a desirable 3D microenvironment for cartilage reconstruction. Furthermore, rapid initial release of E7 during the first few days, followed by slow and sustained release of TGF-β1 for as long as few weeks, synergistically induced the recruitment of BMSCs and chondrogenic differentiation of them in vitro. Finally, in vivo studies indicate that the implantation of the biofunctional scaffold markedly promote in situ cartilage regeneration in a rabbit cartilage defect model. It is believed that this cartilage-biomimetic biofunctional SF-based scaffold with sequential controlled release of E7 and TGF-β1 may have a promising potential for improved cartilage tissue engineering.","","Parsial","0.00","2192-2659","12","1"

A hybrid hydrogel made of synthetic biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) and collagen was applied to coat 3D printed well-structured triangular samples with 30% infill density. The coating process changed the surface texture, increased the average strand diameter and average pore size, and decreased the open porosity of samples, all of which increased the mechanical strength of biomimetic-coated scaffolds. According to matrix mineralization staining and osteo-related gene expression, the coating of scaffolds significantly facilitates metabolic activity and osteogenic differentiation of dental pulp-derived mesenchymal stem cells (DPSCs).

Indeed, to mimic tissue characteristics and stimulate bone regeneration at the interface, it is necessary to reproduce both the mineral and organic components of the tissue ECM, as well as the micro/nano-fibrous morphology. To address this goal, we propose here novel biomimetic patches obtained by the combination of electrospinning and nanostructured bone apatite. In particular, we deposited apatite on the electrospun fibers by Ionized Jet Deposition, a plasma-assisted technique that allows conformal deposition and the preservation in the coating of the target's stoichiometry. The damage to the substrate and fibrous morphology is a polymer-dependent aspect, that can be avoided by properly selecting the substrate composition and deposition parameters. In fact, all the tested polymers (poly(l-lactide), poly(D,l-lactide-co-glycolide, poly(ε-caprolactone), collagen) were effectively coated, and the morphological and thermal characterization revealed that poly(ε-caprolactone) suffered the least damage. The coating of collagen fibers, on the other hand, destroyed the fiber morphology and it could only be performed when collagen is blended with a more resistant synthetic polymer in the nanofibers. Due to the biomimetic composition and multiscale morphology from micro to nano, the poly(ε-caprolactone)-collagen biomimetic patches coated with bone apatite supported MSCs adhesion, patch colonization and early differentiation, while allowing optimal viability.

Reversing cardiac fibrosis represents a key challenge in cardiac regenerative medicine. Reliable in vitro models of human cardiac fibrotic tissue could be useful for preclinical testing of new advanced therapies, addressing the limited predictivity of traditional 2D cell cultures and animal in vivo models. In this work, we engineered a biomimetic in vitro model, reproducing the morphological, mechanical, and chemical cues of native cardiac fibrotic tissue. Polycaprolactone (PCL)-based scaffolds with randomly oriented fibers were fabricated by solution electrospinning technique, showing homogeneous nanofibers with an average size of 131 ± 39 nm. PCL scaffolds were then surface-functionalized with human type I collagen (C1) and fibronectin (F) by dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-mediated mussel-inspired approach (PCL/polyDOPA/C1F), in order to mimic fibrotic cardiac tissue-like ECM composition and support human CF culture. BCA assay confirmed the successful deposition of the biomimetic coating and its stability during 5 days of incubation in phosphate-buffered saline. Immunostaining for C1 and F demonstrated their homogeneous distribution in the coating. AFM mechanical characterization showed that PCL/polyDOPA/C1F scaffolds, in wet conditions, resembled fibrotic tissue stiffness with an average Young's modulus of about 50 kPa. PCL/polyDOPA/C1F membranes supported human CF (HCF) adhesion and proliferation. Immunostaining for α-SMA and quantification of α-SMA-positive cells showed HCF activation into MyoFs in the absence of a transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) profibrotic stimulus, suggesting the intrinsic ability of biomimetic PCL/polyDOPA/C1F scaffolds to sustain the development of cardiac fibrotic tissue. A proof-of-concept study making use of a commercially available antifibrotic drug confirmed the potentialities of the developed in vitro model for drug efficacy testing.

In this study, a modified collagen membrane with a polydopamine-graphene oxide (PDA/GO) complex was synthesized to improve the characteristics of collagen for bone tissue engineering. The successful synthesis of PDA/GO on collagen membranes was verified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The wettability of PDA/GO-modified collagen membranes was considerably improved based on the characterization by water contact angle compared to the uncoated membranes and surface coatings solely by either PDA or GO. The modified PDA/GO coating also enhanced the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and biodegradation rate of collagen membranes.

Mature adipocytes can be reprogrammed in vitro, transforming them into dedifferentiated fat cells (DFATs), which are considered a new type of stem cell, and thereby have a high potential for use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, there are still no reports or findings on in vitro controlling the dedifferentiation. Although ceiling culture performed in related studies is a relatively simple method, its yield is low and does not allow manipulation of mature adipocytes to increase or decrease the dedifferentiation. In this study, to understand the role of physicochemical surface effects on the dedifferentiation of patient-derived mature adipocytes, the surfaces of cell culture flasks were coated with extracellular matrix, basement membrane proteins, and cationic/anionic polymers. Extracellular matrix such as fibronectin and collagen type I, and basement membrane proteins such as collagen type IV and laminin strongly promoted dedifferentiation of mature adipocytes, with laminin showing the highest effect with a DFAT ratio of 2.98 (±0.84).

To address the issue of mesenchymal stem cells losing their stem cell characteristics during two-dimensional (2D) cultivation, this study established three-dimensional cell carriers modified with lung decellularized extracellular matrix and assessed its impact on the life activities of mesenchymal stem cells. Methods: This study employed PET as a substrate material, grafting with polydopamine (PDA), and constructing a decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) coating on its surface, thus creating the PET/PDA/dECM three-dimensional (3D) composite carrier. Subsequently, material characterization of the cellular carriers was conducted, followed by co-culturing with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, aiming to investigate the material's impact on the proliferation and paracrine activity of mesenchymal stem cells. Results and Discussion: Material characterization demonstrated successful grafting of PDA and dECM materials, and it had complete hydrophilicity, high porosity, and excellent mechanical properties. The material was rich in various ECM proteins (collagen I, collagen IV , laminin, fibronectin, elastin), indicating good biocompatibility. In long-term in vitro cultivation (14 days) experiments, the PET/PDA/dECM three-dimensional composite carrier significantly enhanced adhesion and proliferation of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HUCMSCs), with a proliferation rate 1.9 times higher than that of cells cultured on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) at day 14. Furthermore, it effectively maintained the stem cell characteristics, expressing specific antigens for HUCMSCs. Through qPCR, Western blot, and ELISA experiments, the composite carrier markedly promoted the expression and secretion of key cell factors in HUCMSCs.

To improve the anti-infection efficacy of coatings, we have incorporated a natural antibacterial agent methylglyoxal (MGO, a Manuka honey compound) in optimized multilayer coatings. The obtainment of MGO-loaded multilayer coatings was successfully assessed by profilometry, contact angle, attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In vitro degradation confirmed the controlled release activity of MGO with a range of concentrations from 0.90 to 2.38 mM up to 21 days. A bacterial cell culture study using Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) confirmed that the MGO incorporated within layers 7 and 9 had a favorable effect on preventing bacterial growth and colonization on their surfaces. An in vitro cytocompatibility study confirmed that MGO agents included in the layers did not affect or reduce the cellular functionalities of L929 fibroblasts. In addition, MGO-loaded layers with Immortalized Mesenchymal Stem Cells (Y201 TERT-hMSCs) were found to favor the growth and differentiation of Y201 cells and promote calcium nodule formation.

The research provides several key insights. First, 3D spheroid culture, which promotes robust cell-cell interactions, emerges as a critical factor in maintaining fibroblast functionality. Second, substrate stiffness significantly influences results, with the soft collagen hydrogel showing superior support for fibroblast function. Notably, fibroblasts cultured on collagen hydrogel in 2D exhibit comparable functionality to those in 3D, highlighting the importance of substrate mechanical properties.

Reconstructing the osteoconductive bone microenvironment into a scaffold can attract native mesenchymal stem cells and differentiate them into osteoblasts at the defect site. The symbiotic relationship between cell biology and biomaterial engineering could result in composite polymers containing the necessary signals to recreate tissue- and organ-specific differentiation. In the current work, drawing inspiration from the natural stem cell niche to govern stem cell fate, the cell-instructive hydrogel platforms were constructed by engineering the mineralized microenvironment. This work employed two different hydroxyapatite delivery strategies to create a mineralized microenvironment in an alginate-PEGDA interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogel. The first approach involved coating of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp) on poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres and then encapsulating the coated microspheres in an IPN hydrogel for a sustained release of nHAp, whereas the second approach involved directly loading nHAp into the IPN hydrogel. This study demonstrate that both direct encapsulation and a sustained release approach showed enhanced osteogenesis in target-encapsulated cells; however, direct loading of nHAp into the IPN hydrogel increased the mechanical strength and swelling ratio of the scaffold by 4.6-fold and 1.14-fold, respectively. In addition, the biochemical and molecular studies revealed improved osteoinductive and osteoconductive potential of encapsulated target cells. Being less expensive and simple to perform, this approach could be beneficial in clinical settings.","","Parsial","0.00","2373-9878","9","8"

The most important of these effects include cardioprotective, neuroprotective, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, osteoinductive, and anti-microbial effects. Resveratrol has cis and trans isoforms, with the trans isoform being more stable and biologically active. Despite the results of in vitro experiments, resveratrol has limited potential for application in vivo due to its poor water solubility, sensitivity to oxygen, light, and heat, rapid metabolism, and therefore low bioavailability. The possible solution to overcome these limitations could be the synthesis of resveratrol in nanoparticle form. Accordingly, in this study, we have developed a simple, green solvent/non-solvent physicochemical method to synthesize stable, uniform, carrier-free resveratrol nanobelt-like particles (ResNPs) for applications in tissue engineering. UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) was used to identify the trans isoform of ResNPs which remained stable for at least 63 days. The additional qualitative analysis was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), while X-ray diffraction (XRD) determined the monoclinic structure of resveratrol with a significant difference in the intensity of diffraction peaks between commercial and nano-belt form. The morphology of ResNPs was evaluated by optical microscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) that revealed a uniform nanobelt-like structure with an individual thickness of less than 1 μm. Bioactivity was confirmed using Artemia salina in vivo toxicity assay, while 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazylhydrate (DPPH) reduction assay showed the good antioxidative potential of concentrations of 100 μg/ml and lower.

On the contrary, there is an increasing need to develop flexible biohybrid robotic devices capable of maintaining their functionality beyond laboratory settings. In this study, we describe a stretchable and perfusable device to sustain cell culture and maintenance in a 3D scaffold. The device mimics the structure of a muscle connected to two tendons: Tendon-Muscle-Tendon (TMT). The TMT device is composed of a soft (E ∼ 6 kPa) porous (pore diameter: ∼650 μm) polyurethane scaffold, encased within a compliant silicone membrane to prevent medium evaporation. Two tendon-like hollow channels interface the scaffold with a fluidic circuit and a stretching device. We report an optimized protocol to sustain C2C12 adhesion by coating the scaffold with polydopamine and fibronectin. Then, we show the procedure for the soft scaffold inclusion in the TMT device, demonstrating the device's ability to bear multiple cycles of elongations, simulating a protocol for cell mechanical stimulation. By using computational fluid dynamic simulations, we show that a flow rate of 0.62 mL/min ensures a wall shear stress value safe for cells (<2 Pa) and 50% of scaffold coverage by an optimal fluid velocity. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the TMT device to sustain cell viability under perfusion for 24 h outside of the CO2 incubator. We believe that the proposed TMT device can be considered an interesting platform to combine several biophysical stimuli, aimed at boosting skeletal muscle tissue differentiation in vitro, opening chances for the development of muscle-powered biohybrid soft robots with long-term operability in real-world environments.","","Parsial","0.00","2576-6422","6","7"

Retention of biomimetic factors on the scaffolds is likely critical to maximize their benefit, while minimizing the risk of adverse effects, and without losing the beneficial effects of the biomimetic factors. The aim of the current study was to evaluate cross-linking methods to enhance the retention of tendon-derived matrix (TDM) on electrospun poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds. We tested the effects of ultraviolet (UV) or carbodiimide (EDC:NHS:COOH) crosslinking methods to better retain TDM to the scaffolds and stimulate tendon-like matrix synthesis. Initially, we tested various crosslinking configurations of carbodiimide (2.5:1:1, 5:2:1, and 10:4:1 EDC:NHS:COOH ratios) and UV (30 s 1 J/cm2 , 60 s 1 J/cm2 , and 60 s 4 J/cm2 ) on PCL films compared to un-crosslinked TDM. We found that no crosslinking tested retained more TDM than coating alone (Kruskal-Wallis: p > .05), but that human adipose stem cells (hASCs) spread most on the 60 s 1 J/cm2 UV- and 2.5:1:1 EDC-crosslinked films (Kruskal-Wallis: p < .05). Next, we compared the effects of 60 s 1 J/cm2 UV- and 2.5:1:1 EDC-crosslinked to TDM-coated and untreated PCL scaffolds on hASC-induced tendon-like differentiation. UV-crosslinked scaffolds had greater modulus and stiffness than PCL or TDM scaffolds, and hASCs spread more on UV-crosslinked scaffolds (ANOVA: p < .05). Fourier transform infrared spectra revealed that UV- or EDC-crosslinking TDM did not affect the peaks at wavenumbers characteristic of tendon. Crosslinking TDM to electrospun scaffolds improves tendon-like matrix synthesis, providing a viable strategy for improving retention of TDM on electrospun PCL scaffolds.","","Parsial","0.00","1552-4965","111","12"

The alternative tissue engineering approaches have to combine good hardiness of biomaterials whilst allowing good stem cell functionality. To become more useful for load-bearing applications, mechanical properties of calcium phosphate materials have to be improved. In the present study, we aimed to reduce the brittleness of β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP). For this purpose, we used three polymers (PDL-02, -02a, -04) for coatings and compared resulting mechanical and degradation properties as well as their impact on seeded periosteal stem cells. Mechanical properties of coated and uncoated β-TCP scaffolds were analyzed. In addition, degradation kinetics analyses of the polymers employed and of the polymer-coated scaffolds were performed. For bioactivity assessment, the scaffolds were seeded with jaw periosteal cells (JPCs) and cultured under untreated and osteogenic conditions. JPC adhesion/proliferation, gene and protein expression by immunofluorescent staining of embedded scaffolds were analyzed. Raman spectroscopy measurements gave an insight into material properties and cell mineralization. PDL-coated β-TCP scaffolds showed a significantly higher flexural strength in comparison to that of uncoated scaffolds. Degradation kinetics showed considerable differences in pH and electrical conductivity of the three different polymer types, while the core material β-TCP was able to stabilize pH and conductivity. Material differences seemed to have an impact on JPC proliferation and differentiation potential, as reflected by the expression of osteogenic marker genes. A homogenous cell colonialization of coated and uncoated scaffolds was detected. Most interesting from a bone engineer's point of view, the PDL-04 coating enabled detection of cell matrix mineralization by Raman spectroscopy. This was not feasible with uncoated scaffolds, due to intercalating effects of the β-TCP material and the JPC-formed calcium phosphate. In conclusion, the use of PDL-04 coating improved the mechanical properties of the β-TCP scaffold and promoted cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation, whilst allowing detection of cell mineralization within the ceramic core material.","","Parsial","0.00","2079-4983","14","8"

The effects of ligand composition and density on the PGD surface properties and shape, metabolic activity, cell phenotype, and ECM production of human articular chondrocytes (hACs) were evaluated. Introducing ECM ligands on PGD significantly improved its hydrophilicity and promoted the chondrocyte's anabolic activity. The morphology and anabolic activity of hACs on PGD were co-modulated by ligand composition and density, suggesting a combinatorial effect of both coating parameters on chondrocyte function during monolayer culture.

To address this issue, we explored the use of an ECM-based hydrogel coating to serve as an adhesive tool, as demonstrated in vascular tissue engineering. The efficacy of cells to supplement mechanical strength in the coating was explored. Specifically, selected coatings were applied to an engineered artery tunica adventitia to accurately test their properties in a natural tissue support structure. Multiple iterations of three primary hydrogels with and without cells were tested: fibrin, collagen, and gelatin hydrogels with and without fibroblasts. The effectiveness of a natural crosslinker to further stabilize and strengthen the hydrogels was investigated, namely genipin extracted from the gardenia fruit. We found that gelatin crosslinked with genipin alone exhibited the highest tensile strength; however, fibrin gel supported cell viability the most.

Biocompatibility tests of poly-ε-caprolactone nanofibers embedded with hydroxyapatite and alumina nanoparticles manufactured by means of the electrospinning technique were carried out in Wistar rats to be used as oral dressings. Hydroxyapatite as a material is used because of its great compatibility, bioactivity, and osteoconductive properties.

The nanofibers had an average diameter of (840 ± 230) nm. The nanofiber implants were placed and tested at 2, 4, and 6 weeks in the subcutaneous tissue of the rats to give a chronic inflammatory infiltrate, characteristic foreign body reaction, which decreased slightly at 6 weeks with the addition of hydroxyapatite and alumina ceramic particles. The biocompatibility test showed a foreign body reaction that produces a layer of collagen and fibroblasts. Tissue loss and necrosis were not observed due to the coating of the material, but a slight decrease in the inflammatory infiltrate occurred in the last evaluation period, which is indicative of the beginning of the acceptance of the tested materials by the organism.","","Parsial","0.00","2073-4360","14","11"

The delivery of growth factors to these in situ-engineered vascular grafts might enhance myofibroblast recruitment and the secretion of essential extracellular matrix proteins, thereby optimizing their functional properties. Layer-by-layer (LbL) coating has emerged as an innovative technology for the controlled delivery of growth factors in tissue engineering applications. In this study, we combined the use of surface-etched polymeric rods with LbL coatings to control the delivery of TGF-β1, PDGF-BB, and IGF-1 and steer the foreign body response toward the formation of a functional vascular graft. Results showed that the regenerated tissue is composed of elastin, glycosaminoglycans, and circumferentially oriented collagen fibers, without calcification or systemic spill of the released growth factors. Functional controlled delivery was observed, whereas myofibroblast-rich tissue capsules were formed with enhanced collagen and elastin syntheses using TGF-β1 and TGF-β1/PDGF-BB releasing rods, when compared to control rods that were solely surface-engineered by chloroform etching. By combining our optimized LbL method and surface-engineered rods in an in vivo bioreactor approach, we could regulate the fate and ECM composition of in situ-engineered vascular grafts to create a successful in vivo vascular tissue-engineered replacement.","","Ya","0.00","1944-8252","14","25"

Moreover, its porosity enables infiltration of cells, nutrients and waste products. The outcome of hydroxyapatite implantation highly depends on the extent of the host immune response. Authors emphasise major roles of the chemical, morphological and physical properties of the surface of biomaterial used. A number of techniques have been applied to transform the theoretical osteoconductive features of HAp into spinal fusion systems-from integration of HAp with autograft to synthetic intervertebral implants. The most popular uses of HAp in spine surgery include implants (ACDF), bone grafts in posterolateral lumbar fusion and transpedicular screws coating. In the past, autologous bone graft has been used as an intervertebral cage in ACDF. Due to the morbidity related to autograft harvesting from the iliac bone, a synthetic cage with osteoconductive material such as hydroxyapatite seems to be a good alternative. Regarding posterolateral lumbar fusion, it requires the graft to induce new bone growth and reinforce fusion between the vertebrae. Hydroxyapatite formulations have shown good results in that field. Moreover, the HAp coating has proven to be an efficient method of increasing screw fixation strength. It can decrease the risk of complications such as screw loosening after pedicle screw fixation in osteoporotic patients. The purpose of this literature review is to describe in vivo reaction to HAp implants and to summarise its current application in spine surgery.","","Parsial","0.00","1996-1944","15","8"

The effects of apatite coating on the scaffold characteristics (i.e., surface morphology, water absorption, Ca release, protein adsorption, and enzymatic degradation resistance) were assessed. Cyto-compatibility and the osteogenic properties of Ap-CS and CS were assessed in vitro using preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, we performed in vivo studies to evaluate bone augmentation and periodontal tissue reconstruction with Ap-CS and CS in a rat skull and canine furcation lesion, respectively.

However, long-term implantation is usually associated with complications, such as capsular contracture due to excessive local inflammatory response, subsequently requiring implant removal. Therefore, modification of the silicone surface to reduce a risk of capsular contracture has attracted increasing attention. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) are known to provide potentially therapeutic applications for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and reconstructive surgery. Herein, hASCs coating on a PDMS (hASC-PDMS) or itaconic acid (IA)-conjugated PDMS (hASC-IA-PDMS) surface is examined to determine its biocompatibility for reducing capsular contracture on the PDMS surface. In vitro cell cytotoxicity evaluation showed that hASCs on IA-PDMS exhibit higher cell viability than hASCs on PDMS. A lower release of proinflammatory cytokines is observed in hASC-PDMS and hASC-IA-PDMS compared to the cells on plate. Multiple factors, including in vivo mRNA expression levels of cytokines related to fibrosis; number of inflammatory cells; number of macrophages and myofibroblasts; capsule thickness; and collagen density following implantation in rats for 60 days, indicate that incorporated coating hASCs on PDMSs most effectively reduces capsular contracture. This study demonstrates the potential of hASCs coating for the modification of PDMS surfaces in enhancing surface biocompatibility for reducing capsular contracture of PDMS-based medical devices.","","Parsial","0.00","2380-6761","7","1"

When evaluated against a mechanically matched poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) formulation, the PU-PEG hydrogels demonstrated favorable nonfouling characteristics, including comparable adsorption of plasma proteins (albumin and fibrinogen) and significantly reduced cellular adhesion. Moreover, preliminary murine implant studies reveal a mild foreign body response after 41 days. Due to the tunable mechanical properties, excellent biocompatibility, and sustained in vivo tolerability of these hydrogels, it is proposed that this method offers a simplified platform for fabricating soft PU-based biomaterials for a variety of applications.","","Parsial","0.00","2192-2659","11","21"

Excluded non-collagenous protein (NCPs) and carbohydrates also participate in critical cell signaling cascades and guide mineral deposition during intermediate stages of bone healing. By mimicking the native fracture repair process, polymeric scaffolds that incorporate calcium-binding moieties present in fibrocartilage can potentially enhance their bioactivity, mineralization, and bone growth. Likewise, coating polymeric fibers with serum albumin is an additional strategy that can impart collagen-like biofunctionality and further increase mineral deposition on the fibrous surface. Here, a combination of electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers with chondrocyte-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) and albumin coating were investigated as a fibrocartilage-mimetic scaffold that can serve as a woven bone precursor for bone regeneration. PCL fibrous constructs coated with dECM and albumin are shown to synergistically increase calcium concentration and calcium phosphate (CaP) deposition in a simulated body fluid biomineralization assay. Albumin/dECM coating increased osteoblast proliferation and mineral deposition in culture. In contrast, CaP coating transformed osteoblast bone lining morphology into cuboidal phenotype and arrested their proliferation. Cell sheets of osteoblasts cultured on dECM/albumin/CaP-coated constructs exhibited an increase in calcium deposition and secretion of collagen, osteopontin, osteocalcin, and bone morphogenetic protein. These results highlight the potential of biomolecular coatings to enhance bone-mimetic properties of synthetic nanofibrous scaffolds, stimulate critical protein and mineral deposition, and augment the bone's capacity to heal. Thus, mimicking the intermediate stages of bone regeneration by incorporating calcium-binding moieties may prove to be a useful strategy for improving the clinical outcomes of synthetic bone grafts.","","Parsial","0.00","2576-6422","5","12"

In this study, we assessed QHM polymer cytocompatibility, amenability to fibrin-coating, immobilization and persistence of GDF-7, and capability to support GDF-7-mediated tendon differentiation in vitro as well as in vivo in mouse subcutaneous and acute rat rotator cuff tendon resection models. Cytocompatibility studies showed that QHM facilitated cell attachment, proliferation, and viability.

In this study, we present an innovative method to extract human ECM derived from the Wharton's jelly (WJ-ECMaa) of umbilical cords as a novel biomaterial to be used in tissue engineering. WJ-ECMaa was very efficiently decellularized, suggesting its possible use in allogeneic conditions.

Mosquito-inspired microneedles have been fabricated from a variety of materials, including biocompatible metals and polymers, to mimic of the mouthparts that some mosquitoes use to bite a host with minimal injury during blood collection. The salivary components that these mosquitoes use to reduce the clotting of blood extracted during the biting process provide a rich source of anticoagulants that could potentially be integrated into blood-contacting biomaterials or administered in therapeutics to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Mosquito movement, vision, and olfaction are other behaviors that also have the potential for inspiring the development of medically relevant technologies.

Additionally, dexamethasone was excluded to enable an accurate interpretation of BGN and EF in supporting osteogenic differentiation. Here, we demonstrated the influences of BGN and EF on collagen topography and maintaining coating stability. Coupled with the release profile of Si ions from the BGN, cell proliferation and calcium deposition were enhanced in the Col-BGN samples after 28 days. Further, osteogenic differentiation was initiated as early as d 7, and each EF regime was shown to activate distinct pathways. The disrupted (4/4) regime was associated with the BMP/Smad4 pathways that up-regulate Runx2/OCN gene expression on d 7, with a lesser effect on ALP activity.

However, these materials face challenges in terms of pore-size limitations since they are characterized by nanopores ranging between 6-8 nm and thus unsuitable to host large molecular weight molecules such as proteins, enzymes and growth factors (GFs). In this work, for an application in the field of bone regeneration, large-pore mesoporous silicas (LPMSs) were developed to vehicle large biomolecules and release them under a pH stimulus. Considering bone remodeling, the proposed pH-triggered mechanism aims to mimic the release of GFs encased in the bone matrix due to bone resorption by osteoclasts (OCs) and the associated pH drop. To this aim, LPMSs were prepared by using 1,3,5-trimethyl benzene (TMB) as a swelling agent and the synthesis solution was hydrothermally treated and the influence of different process temperatures and durations on the resulting mesostructure was investigated. The synthesized particles exhibited a cage-like mesoporous structure with accessible pores of diameter up to 23 nm. LPMSs produced at 140 °C for 24 h showed the best compromise in terms of specific surface area, pores size and shape and hence, were selected for further experiments. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used as model protein to evaluate the ability of the LPMSs to adsorb and release large biomolecules. After HRP-loading, LPMSs were coated with a pH-responsive polymer, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), allowing the release of the incorporated biomolecules in response to a pH decrease, in an attempt to mimic GFs release in bone under the acidic pH generated by the resorption activity of OCs. The reported results proved that PEG-coated carriers released HRP more quickly in an acidic environment, due to the protonation of PEG at low pH that catalyzes polymer hydrolysis reaction. Our findings indicate that LPMSs could be used as carriers to deliver large biomolecules and prove the effectiveness of PEG as pH-responsive coating. Finally, as proof of concept, a collagen-based suspension was obtained by incorporating PEG-coated LPMS carriers into a type I collagen matrix with the aim of designing a hybrid formulation for 3D-printing of bone scaffolds.","","Parsial","0.00","1422-0067","22","4"

The number and the spreading area of the initially adhered cells, their growth rate during 7 days after seeding and the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly higher on the NCD-coated samples than on the uncoated O-SiOx samples. In addition, the concentration of type I collagen was significantly higher in the cells on the O-NCD-coated samples than on the bare O-SiOx samples. The observed differences could be attributed to the tunable wettability of NCD and to the more appropriate surface morphology of the NCD-coated samples in contrast to the less stable, rapidly eroding bare SiOx surface. The H-NCD coatings and the O-NCD coatings both promoted similar initial adhesion of Saos-2 cells, but the subsequent cell proliferation activity was higher on the O-NCD-coated samples. The concentration of beta-actin, vinculin, type I collagen and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the ALP activity, and also the calcium deposition tended to be higher in the cells on the O-NCD-coated samples than on the H-NCD-coated samples, although these differences did not reach statistical significance. The improved cell performance on the O-NCD-coated samples could be attributed to higher wettability of these samples (water drop contact angle less than 10°), while the H-NCD-coated samples were hydrophobic (contact angle >70°). NCD-coated porous SiOx meshes can therefore be considered as appropriate scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, particularly those with an O-terminated NCD coating.","","Parsial","0.00","1873-0191","121",""

Despite their advances in recent years, there exist still some challenges which have yet to be addressed, such as long-term stability under physiological conditions, adequate long-term conductivity and optimal biocompatibility. Additionally, another hurdle to the use of these materials is their adaptation towards three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds, a feature that is usually achieved by virtue of applying CPs as a functionalised coating on a bulk material. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is by far one of the most promising CPs in terms of its stability and conductivity, with the latter capable of being enhanced via a crystallisation treatment using sulphuric acid. In this work, we present a new generation of 3D electroconductive porous biomaterial scaffolds based on PEDOT:PSS crosslinked via glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GOPS) and subjected to sulphuric acid crystallisation. The resultant isotropic and anisotropic crystallised porous scaffolds exhibited, on an average, a 1000-fold increase in conductivity when compared with the untreated scaffolds. Moreover, we also document a precise control over the pore microarchitecture, size and anisotropy with high repeatability to achieve both isotropic and aligned scaffolds with mechanical and electrical anisotropy, while exhibiting adequate biocompatibility. These findings herald a new approach towards generating anisotropic porous biomaterial scaffolds with superior conductivity through a safe and scalable post-treatment.","","Parsial","0.00","2047-4849","9","12"

In this study, MAO treatment has been performed to modify the surface characteristics of AZ31 Mg alloy to enhance the biocompatibility and corrosion resistance for implant applications by using an electrolytic mixture of Ca3(PO4)2 and C10H16N2O8 (EDTA) in the solutions. For this purpose, the calcium phosphate (Ca-P) containing thin film was successfully fabricated on the surface of the implant material. After in-vivo implantation into the rabbit bone for four weeks, the apparent growth of soft tissues and bone healing effects have been documented. The morphology, microstructure, chemical composition, and phase structures of the coating were identified by SEM, XPS, and XRD. The corrosion resistance of the coating was analyzed by polarization and salt spray test. The coatings consist of Ca-P compounds continuously have proliferation activity and show better corrosion resistance and lower roughness in comparison to mere MAO coated AZ31. The corrosion current density decreased to approximately 2.81 × 10-7 A/cm2 and roughness was reduced to 0.622 μm. Thus, based on the results, it was anticipated that the development of degradable materials and implants would be feasible using this method. This study aims to fabricate MAO coatings for orthopedic magnesium implants that can enhance bioactivity, biocompatibility, and prevent additional surgery and implant-related infections to be used in clinical applications.","","Parsial","0.00","1422-0067","22","9"

In this study, SF scaffolds were coated with fibronectin/gelatin (Fn/G) to improve cell adhesion. Furthermore, the effect of pore size in Fn/G coated SF scaffolds on osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were investigated in vitro. Scaffolds with average pore diameters of 384.52, 275.23, and 173.8 μm were prepared by salt leaching method, labelled as Large, Medium, and Small group. Porcine BMSCs were seeded on scaffolds and cultured in osteogenic medium for 21 days to evaluate cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium deposition, gene expression of osteogenic markers, and histological performance. The results showed Fn/G coating effectively improved cell adhesion on SF scaffolds. Cell metabolic rate in each group increased significantly with time, but there was no statistical difference at each time point among the three groups. On day 21, ALP/DNA and calcium/DNA in the Small group were significantly higher than those in the Large group. Among the three pore sizes, the Small group showed higher mRNA expression of COl I on day 7, OPN on day 14, and OCN on day 21. Immunohistochemical staining on day 21 showed that Col I and OCN in Small group were more highly expressed.

As myoblasts possess anti-inflammatory capacity and improve wound healing, we developed a multilayered human skeletal muscle myoblast (HSMM) sheet by periodic exposure to supraphysiological hydrostatic pressure during repeated cell seeding. We assessed whether the application of an HSMM sheet can promote the healing process after colonic anastomosis. Partial colectomy and insufficient suturing were employed to create a high-risk colo-colonic anastomosis model in 60 nude rats. Rats were divided into a control group (n = 30) and an HSMM sheet group (n = 30). Macroscopic findings, anastomotic bursting pressure, and histology at the colonic anastomotic site were evaluated on postoperative day (POD) 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28. The application of an HSMM sheet significantly suppressed abscess formation at the anastomotic site compared to the control group on POD3 and 5. The anastomotic bursting pressure in the HSMM sheet group was higher than that in the control group on POD3 and 5. Inflammatory cell infiltration in the HSMM sheet group was significantly suppressed compared to that in the control group throughout the time course. Collagen deposition in the HSMM sheet group on POD3 was significantly abundant compared to that in the control group. Regeneration of the mucosa at the colonic anastomotic site was promoted in the HSMM sheet group compared to that in the control group on POD14 and 28. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that surviving cells in the HSMM sheet gradually decreased with postoperative time and none were detected on POD14.

Another advantage is its structural similarity with many mammalian collagen types, providing a biocompatible matrix for different cell types as ""collagen type 0"". This paper intends to investigate jellyfish collagen (Jellagen®) in two applications. This investigation aims to establish an initial understanding of jellyfish collagen in biotechnology. More specifically, in cell culture and the field of tissue engineering. The jellyfish collagen was comparatively tested as a coating material for multi-well plates as one of the most extensively used tools in cell culture and in the form of three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds intended for bone tissue engineering (BTE) applications. Both, the coated well plates and the scaffolds were seeded with fibroblasts and pre-osteoblasts, separately. In vitro cytocompatibility assays in accordance with EN ISO 10993-5/-12 regulations and LIVE-DEAD-stainings were carried out to study the cell viability, cytotoxicity and proliferation of these two cell lines. The results showed that collagen extracted from R. pulmo jellyfish can be an alternative to mammalian-derived collagen. Fibroblasts showed comparable cell viability to the medium control and an increased cell proliferation on the well plates indicating that these coated well plates can be used in cell culture, particularly in biocompatibility studies of biomaterials (as fibroblasts are used in this respective field extensively). The viability of pre-osteoblasts significantly exceeded the medium control in case of the jellyfish 3D scaffolds. These cells exhibited favorable healthy behavior on this marine collagen, suggesting that Jellagen® collagen can be used in studies of (bone) tissue regeneration and especially as scaffolds in BTE.

The relative contributions of the nanotopographical pattern (physical factor) and gelatin coating (chemical factor) in enhancing the mechanical and adhesive properties of PCL were quantitatively investigated. The nanotopographical pattern increased the surface area of PCL, allowing more gelatin to be coated on its surface. The biomedical patch made from gelatin-coated nanopatterned PCL showed strong mechanical and adhesive properties (tensile strength: ~14.5 MPa; Young's modulus: ~60.2 MPa; and normal and shear adhesive forces: ~1.81 N/cm2 and ~352.3 kPa) as well as good biocompatibility.

The osteogenic potential of combining matrices and protein growth factors has been well documented, however, improvements are necessary to achieve optimal therapeutic benefits upon clinical translation. In this article, rat calvarial defects were treated with gene-activated matrices (GAMs). The GAMs used were collagen sponges mineralized with a simulated body fluid (SBF) containing a nonviral gene delivery system. Both in vitro and in vivo studies were performed to determine the optimal mode of gene delivery. After 6 weeks, the defects were extracted to assess bone formation and tissue quality through histological and microcomputed tomography analyses. The optimal GAM consisted of a collagen sponge with polyethylenimine plasmid DNA (PEI-pDNA) complexes embedded in a calcium phosphate coating produced by SBF, which increased total bone formation by 39% compared with 19% for control samples. A follow-up in vivo study was performed to optimize the ratio of growth factors included in the GAM. The optimal ratio for supporting bone formation after 6 weeks of implantation was five parts of pBMP-2 to three parts pFGF-2. These studies demonstrated that collagen matrices biomimetically mineralized and activated with plasmids encoding fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) can optimally improve bone regeneration outcomes. Impact statement Bone tissue engineering has explored both nonviral gene delivery and the concept of biomimetic mineralization. In this study, we combined these two concepts to further enhance bone regeneration outcomes. We demonstrated that embedding polyethylenimine (PEI)-based gene delivery within a mineral layer formed from simulated body fluid (SBF) immersion can increase bone formation rates. We also demonstrated that the ratio of growth factors utilized for matrix fabrication can impact the amount of bone formed in the defect site.

All defects were covered with a resorbable collagen membrane. Animals were euthanized after 3 and 12 weeks of healing and samples were investigated by micro-CT and histologic analysis. Ingrowth of newly formed woven bone from the original bone at 3-week healing period was observed in all samples. At the 12-week healing period, the new bone in the peripheral area was mainly lamellar and in the central region composed of both woven and lamellar bone. New bony tissue was found on the surface of all three types of granules and at the interior of the BBCP1 granules. Samples with 3% HA showed significantly less residual biomaterial in comparison to the other two groups. Furthermore, BBCP1 significantly promoted new bone area as compared to other three groups and more bone volume as compared to the control. Within its limitations, this study indicated the highest degradation rate in case of BBCP1 concomitant with the highest rate of bone formation. Hence, formation of new bone can be affected by the level of biomimetic HA coating of α-TCP.","","Parsial","0.00","1573-4838","32","1"

Several biomolecules have been used as part of drug delivery systems to improve implant integration into the surrounding bone tissue. Chemically modified mRNA (cmRNA) is a new form of therapeutic that has been used to induce bone healing. Combined with biomaterials, cmRNA can be used to develop transcript-activated matrices for local protein production with osteoinductive potential. In this study, we aimed to utilize this technology to create bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) transcript-activated coatings for titanium (Ti) implants. Therefore, different coating methodologies as well as cmRNA incorporation strategies were evaluated. Three different biocompatible biomaterials were used for the coating of Ti, namely, poly-d,l-lactic acid (PDLLA), fibrin, and fibrinogen. cmRNA-coated Ti disks were assayed for transfection efficiency, cmRNA release, cell viability and proliferation, and osteogenic activity in vitro. We found that cmRNA release was significantly delayed in Ti surfaces previously coated with biomaterials. Consequently, the transfection efficiency was greatly improved. PDLLA coating improved the transfection efficiency in a concentration-dependent manner. Lower PDLLA concentration used for the coating of Ti resulted in higher transfection efficiency. Fibrin and fibrinogen coatings showed even higher transfection efficiencies compared to all PDLLA concentrations. In those disks, not only the expression was up to 24-fold higher but also the peak of maximal expression was delayed from 24 h to 5 days, and the duration of expression was also extended until 7 days post-transfection. For fibrin, higher transfection efficiencies were obtained in the coatings with the lowest thrombin amounts. Accordingly, fibrinogen coatings gave the best results in terms of cmRNA transfection. All biomaterial-coated Ti surfaces showed improved cell viability and proliferation, though this was more noticeable in the fibrinogen-coated disks. The latter was also the only coating to support significant amounts of BMP2 produced by C2C12 cells in vitro. Osteogenesis was confirmed using BMP2 cmRNA fibrinogen-coated Ti disks, and it was dependent of the cmRNA amount present. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of C2C12 increased when using fibrinogen coatings containing 250 ng of cmRNA or more. Similarly, mineralization was also observed that increased with increasing cmRNA concentration. Overall, our results support fibrinogen as an optimal material to deliver cmRNA from titanium-coated surfaces.","","Ya","0.00","1543-8392","18","3"

In this regard, intelligent extracellular matrix (ECM) mimetic scaffolds have recently evolved as a promising paradigm by presenting instructive cues directing cell-matrix communication, tissue remodeling and homeostasis. However, orchestring multitude attributes of skin ECM yet presents an intriguing challenge to be addressed. In the present work, we have developed an in vitro skin scaffold by coating a bio-mimetic ECM cue κ-carrageenan on electrospun nanofibers for the first time. κ-Carrageenan, a natural sulfated algal polysaccharide exhibits close similarity with native glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) of skin ECM. On the other hand, electrospun nanofibers resemble the 3D nano-topographic architecture of ECM. In the coated form, κ-carrageenan could provide the biochemical cues necessary for cellular functions on the nanofibrous scaffold, thereby mimicking the native 3D microenvironment of skin ECM. The nano-architecture of the electrospun matrix is retained in the fabricated scaffold even after coating with κ-carrageenan. The developed biomimetic scaffold significantly supplements adhesion, growth, infiltration, survival and proliferation of fibroblasts. Furthermore, enhanced gene expression and excessive secretion of collagen proteins by fibroblasts communicate a conducive skin ECM micro-environment formation on the algal polysaccharide coated nanofibrous scaffold. Taken together, these findings present a simple yet effective strategy for the fabrication of ECM mimetic scaffold for promising skin tissue engineering applications.","","Parsial","0.00","1873-0191","119",""

Nanocarriers from murine serum albumin (MSA) were prepared by an inverse miniemulsion technique encapsulating either a low- or high-molar mass fluorescent cargo. PPE implants were subsequently coated with these nanocarriers. In control cohorts, the implant was coated with the homologue non-encapsulated cargo substance by dip coating.

Osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) following treatment with primed EVs was evaluated by assessing alkaline phosphatase activity, collagen production and calcium deposition. Triangle pore scaffolds significantly increased osteoblast mineralisation (1.5-fold) when compared to square architectures (P ≤ 0.001). Interestingly, EV yield was also significantly enhanced on these higher permeability structures (P ≤ 0.001), in particular (2.2-fold) for the larger pore structures (1000 µm).

These stiff, shrunken scars limit mobility, impact quality of life, and cost millions of dollars each year in surgical treatment and physical therapy. Current tissue engineered scaffolds have mechanical properties akin to unwounded skin, but these collagen-based scaffolds rapidly degrade over 2 months, premature to dampen contracture occurring 6-12 months after injury. This study demonstrates a tissue engineered scaffold can be manufactured from a slow-degrading viscoelastic copolymer, poly(ι-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone), with physical and mechanical characteristics to promote tissue ingrowth and support skin-grafts. Copolymers were synthesized via ring-opening polymerization. Solvent casting/particulate leaching was used to manufacture 3D porous scaffolds by mixing copolymers with particles in an organic solvent followed by casting into molds and subsequent particle leaching with water. Scaffolds characterized through SEM, micro-CT, and tensile testing confirmed the required thickness, pore size, porosity, modulus, and strength for promoting skin-graft bioincorporation and dampening fibrosis in vivo. Scaffolds were Oxygen Plasma Treatment and collagen coated to encourage cellular proliferation. Porosity ranging from 70% to 90% was investigated in a subcutaneous murine model and found to have no clinical effect on tissue ingrowth. A swine full-thickness skin wound model confirmed through histology and Computer Planimetry that scaffolds promote skin-graft survival, with or without collagen coating, with equal safety and efficacy as a commercially available tissue engineered scaffold. This study validates a scalable method to create poly(ι-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) scaffolds with appropriate characteristics and confirms in mouse and swine wound models that the scaffolds are safe and effective at supporting skin-grafts. The results of this study have brought us closer towards developing an alternative technology that supports skin grafts with the potential to investigate long-term hypertrophic scar contractures.","","Parsial","0.00","1524-475X","29","6"

In this work, a self-assembling ultra-short surfactant-like peptide I3K which possesses positively charged lysine head groups, and hydrophobic isoleucine tails, was chosen to investigate its potential for guiding neuronal cell growth. The peptides were able to self-assemble into nanofibrous structures and interact strongly with silk fibroin (SF) scaffolds, providing a niche for neural cell attachment and proliferation. SF is an excellent biomaterial for tissue engineering. However neuronal cells, such as rat PC12 cells, showed poor attachment on pure regenerated SF (RSF) scaffold surfaces. Patterning of I3K peptide nanofibers on RSF surfaces significantly improved cellular attachment, cellular density, as well as morphology of PC12 cells. The live / dead assay confirmed that RSF and I3K have negligible cytotoxicity against PC12 cells. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to image the topography and neurite formation of PC12 cells, where results revealed that self-assembled I3K nanofibers can support the formation of PC12 cell neurites. Immunolabelling also demonstrated that coating of I3K nanofibers onto the RSF surfaces not only increased the percentage of cells bearing neurites but also increased the average maximum neurite length. Therefore, the peptide I3K could be used as an alternative to poly-l-lysine for cell culture and tissue engineering applications. As micro-patterning of neural cells to guide neurite growth is important for developing nerve tissue engineering scaffolds, inkjet printing was used to pattern self-assembled I3K peptide nanofibers on RSF surfaces for directional control of PC12 cell growth. The results demonstrated that inkjet-printed peptide micro-patterns can effectively guide the cell alignment and organization on RSF scaffold surfaces, providing great potential for nerve regeneration applications.","","Parsial","0.00","1095-7103","603",""

To further enhance the biocompatibility, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and basic fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) were loaded separately as dual growth factors, allowing for progressive drug release following the natural process of bone regeneration. The first burst release of FGF-2 triggered the proliferation of surrounding cells, and the subsequent release of BMP-2 stimulated their differentiation. The microstructure, surface potential, hardness, reduced Young's modulus, and wettability were assessed using scanning electron microscopy, nanoindentation, and water contact angle. The formation of apatite layers after immersion in simulated body fluid confirmed the bioactivity of this PEM. PEMs loaded with BMP-2 and FGF-2 showed a long sustained release of growth factors for up to 48 days.

Electrochemical sensing with fast response and high sensitivity has played a vital role in real-time monitoring of living cells, but most current sensors are based on planar electrodes and fail to perfectly match the 3D cell culture matrix. Herein, we developed a robust 3D electrochemical sensor based on functionalized graphene foam (GF), which could be integrated with hydrogels for the 3D culture and in situ monitoring of cells for the first time. Specifically, platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) electrodeposited on GF (GF/Pt NPs) conferred the prominent electrochemical sensing performance, and the anti-fouling coating of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) endowed the GF/Pt NPs electrode with greatly improved stability. As a proof of concept, collagen hydrogel with microglia seeded in was filled into the interspace of the 3D GF/Pt NPs/PEDOT sensor to establish an integrated platform, which allowed the successful real-time monitoring of reactive oxygen species released from microglia in the collagen matrix.

It was found that the SPION coated scaffold induced better bone regeneration than that achieved by the controls. Furthermore, it significantly decreased the operational taxonomic units (OTU) numbers as determined by 16 s rRNA gene sequencing, and also resulted in decreased Chao and ACE alpha diversity indexes compared with those of the controls. However, it had no effect on beta diversity. SPION coated scaffolds caused a shift in oral bacterial composition characterized by a decrease in the Clostridium spp. population, and the dominant flora being Proteobacteria. Furthermore, SPION coated scaffolds upregulated the concentration of serum iron, hepcidin, and P1NP. Thus, SPION coated scaffolds enhanced bone regeneration, and this effect was partly related to alteration of the oral microbiota by the antibacterial effects of SPION.

Graphene-based scaffolds combined with stem cells deserve special attention to enhance tissue regeneration in a controlled manner.

The current work aims to investigate in vitro biological effects of three-dimensional (3D) graphene oxide (GO)/sodium alginate (GOSA) and reduced GOSA (RGOSA) scaffolds on dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in terms of cell viability and cytotoxicity. Herein, the effects of the 3D scaffolds, coating conditions, and serum supplementation on DPSCs functions are explored extensively. Biodegradation analysis revealed that the addition of GO enhanced the degradation rate of composite scaffolds. Compared to the 2D surface, the cell viability of 3D scaffolds was higher (p < 0.0001), highlighting the optimal initial cell adhesion to the scaffold surface and cell migration through pores. Moreover, the cytotoxicity study indicated that the incorporation of graphene supported higher DPSCs viability. It is also shown that when the mean pore size of the scaffold increases, DPSCs activity decreases. In terms of coating conditions, poly- l-lysine was the most robust coating reagent that improved cell-scaffold adherence and DPSCs metabolism activity. The cytotoxicity of GO-based scaffolds showed that DPSCs can be seeded in serum-free media without cytotoxic effects. This is critical for human translation as cellular transplants are typically serum-free.

In the present study, we aimed to comparatively investigate the migratory, adhesive, proliferative, and differentiation potential of mesenchymal stromal ST2 and pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells in response to four 3D collagen-based matrices. Dried acellular dermal matrix (DADM), hydrated acellular dermal matrix (HADM), non-crosslinked collagen matrix (NCM), and crosslinked collagen matrix (CCM) did all enhance the motility of the osteoprogenitor cells. Compared to DADM and NCM, HADM and CCM triggered stronger migratory response. While cells grown on DADM and NCM demonstrated proliferative rates comparable to control cells grown in the absence of a biomaterial, cells grown on HADM and CCM proliferated significantly faster. The pro-proliferative effects of the two matrices were supported by upregulated expression of genes regulating cell division. Increased expression of genes encoding the adhesive molecules fibronectin, vinculin, CD44 antigen, and the intracellular adhesive molecule-1 was detected in cells grown on each of the scaffolds, suggesting excellent adhesive properties of the investigated biomaterials. In contrast to genes encoding the bone matrix proteins collagen type I (Col1a1) and osteopontin (Spp1) induced by all matrices, the expression of the osteogenic differentiation markers Runx2, Alpl, Dlx5, Ibsp, Bglap2, and Phex was significantly increased in cells grown on HADM and CCM only. Short/clinically relevant pre-coating of the 3D biomaterials with enamel matrix derivative (EMD) or recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rBMP-2) significantly boosted the osteogenic differentiation of both osteoprogenitor lines on all matrices, including DADM and NCM, indicating that EMD and BMP-2 retained their biological activity after being released from the matrices. Whereas EMD triggered the expression of all osteogenesis-related genes, rBMP-2 upregulated early, intermediate, and late osteogenic differentiation markers except for Col1a1 and Spp1. Altogether, our results support favorable influence of HADM and CCM on the recruitment, growth, and osteogenic differentiation of the osteoprogenitor cell types.

Therefore, in this study, we fabricated piezoelectric scaffolds by functionalization of polycaprolactone-tricalcium phosphate (PCL-TCP) films with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) coating that is self-polarized by a modified breath-figure technique. The osteoinductive properties of these PVDF-coated PCL-TCP films on MC3T3-E1 cells were studied under the stimulation of PEMF. Piezoelectric and ferroelectric characterization demonstrated that scaffolds with piezoelectric coefficient d33 = -1.2 pC/N were obtained at a powder dissolution temperature of 100 °C and coating relative humidity (RH) of 56%. DNA quantification showed that cell proliferation was significantly enhanced by PEMF as low as 0.6 mT and 50 Hz. Hydroxyapatite staining showed that cell mineralization was significantly enhanced by incorporation of PVDF coating. Gene expression study showed that the combination of PEMF and PVDF coating promoted late osteogenic gene expression marker most significantly. Collectively, our results suggest that the synergistic effects of PEMF and piezoelectric scaffolds on osteogenesis provide a promising alternative strategy for electrically augmented osteoinduction. The piezoelectric response of PVDF by PEMF, which could provide mechanical strain, is particularly interesting as it could deliver local mechanical stimulation to osteogenic cells using PEMF.","","Parsial","0.00","1422-0067","22","12"

The ultrasonic spray coating technology was optimized for coating titanium screws and pericardial collagen membranes, with the aim to improve osseo-integration and (guided) bone regeneration, respectively, without interfering with their primary mode of action. In vitro release analysis of collagen membranes and screws showed up to 21 days sustained release of the compounds without a burst release.

Such scaffolds must possess surface molecular cues that stimulate cells to populate the device, the first necessary condition for the formation of a healthy tissue. Chitosan is a natural polymer that has long been tested in biomedical applications because of its high biocompatibility, which can be further increased by modifying its formulation, e.g. adding D-(+) raffinose. We used this formulation in an ad hoc designed 3D printer to create regularly ordered scaffolds, which we then enriched with type IV collagen, an isoform of collagen that is exclusively found in basement membranes. Human epithelial A549 cells were then seeded on control scaffolds or on scaffolds coated with collagen, which was precipitated, or on scaffolds first collagenized and then exposed to either UVB or UVC radiation. Observations by the transmission light microscope, confocal microscope after staining with calcein-AM/propidium iodide, and by environmental scanning electron microscope revealed that collagen-enriched UV-treated scaffolds promoted the attachment of a higher number of cells, which covered a more extensive area of the scaffold, as also confirmed by alamar blue viability assay. Together these data confirm that coating 3D-printed scaffolds made of D-(+) raffinose-modified chitosan with type IV collagen and exposing them to UV light sensibly increases the cell compatibility of scaffolds, making them a better candidate to serve as a tool for the regeneration of epithelia.","","Parsial","0.00","1748-605X","15","5"

To solve these problems, scaffold consisting of inert biomaterial, high-density polyethylene (Medpor®) encapsulated with neocartilage, biodegradable poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) was created using a tissue engineering strategy. PLGA scaffold without Medpor® was created to serve as the control. Scaffolds were vacuum-seeded with rabbit chondrocytes, freshly isolated from the ear by enzymatic digestion. Then, cell-seeded scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsal pockets of nude mice. After 12 weeks, explants were analyzed by histological, biochemical, and mechanical evaluations. Although the PLGA group resulted in neocartilage formation, the PLGA-Medpor® group demonstrated improved outcome with the formation of well-surrounded cartilage around the implants with higher mechanical strength than the PLGA group, indicating that Medpor® has an influence on the structural strength of engineered cartilage. The presence of collagen and elastin fibers was evident in the histological section in both groups. These results demonstrated a novel method of coating implant material with engineered cartilage to overcome the limitations of using biodegradable scaffold in cartilage tissue regeneration. By utilizing the patient's own chondrocytes, our proposed method may broaden the choice of implant materials while minimizing side effects and immune reaction for the future medical application.","","Ya","0.00","2079-4983","11","2"

After 3, 6, 9, and 12 days, intravital fluorescence microscopy was conducted for determination of capillary diameter, density, flow, and length. At Day 12, samples were examined immunohistologically for expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), CD11b, CD68, αSMA, and CD34. In all CM, intravital fluorescence microscopy over time showed increasing values for all parameters with the highest levels in CM4 and the lowest values in CM1. Significant lower amounts of FGFR4, CD11b, and CD68 were detected in CM4 when compared to CM2 (p < .05). In contrast to CM3, lower values of αSMA and higher numbers of CD34 positive-marked vessels were observed in CM4 (p < .05). In conclusion, dermal bilayer as well as pericardial CM seem to have a higher vascularization rate than dermal homogenous CM. Additional coating of pericardial CM with a silica-enhanced hydroxyapatite increases the speed of vascularization as well as biological remodeling processes.","","Parsial","0.00","1552-4965","108","12"

A series of in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed the ability of Lf to promote survival, proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast cells and to inhibit bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts. Although the mechanism underlying the action of Lf in bone cells is still not fully elucidated, it has been shown that its mode of action leading to the survival of osteoblasts is complemented by its mitogenic effect. Activation of several signalling pathways and gene expression, in an LRPdependent or independent manner, has been identified. Unlike the effects on osteoblasts, the action on osteoclasts is different, with Lf leading to a total arrest of osteoclastogenesis. Due to the positive effect of Lf on osteoblasts, the potential use of Lf alone or in combination with different biologically active compounds in bone tissue regeneration and the treatment of bone diseases is of great interest. Since the bioavailability of Lf in vivo is poor, a nanotechnology- based strategy to improve the biological properties of Lf was developed. The investigated formulations include incorporation of Lf into collagen membranes, gelatin hydrogel, liposomes, loading onto nanofibers, porous microspheres, or coating onto silica/titan based implants. Lf has also been coupled with other biologically active compounds such as biomimetic hydroxyapatite, in order to improve the efficacy of biomaterials used in the regulation of bone homeostasis.

Donut-shaped silicon splints were utilized to prevent wound contraction in mouse skin and simulate re-epithelialization, which is the normal path of human wound healing. Skin regeneration using the bilayer scaffold was compared with AM and untreated defect after 30 d.

In addition, mRNA expression of IVL, P63, interleukin-6, and cyclooxygenase-2 was studied. The application of bilayer scaffold resulted in the best epidermal and dermal regeneration, demonstrated by histopathological examination and molecular analysis. In regenerated wounds of the bilayer scaffold group, the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 and cyclooxygenase-2) were downregulated, and the expression pattern of keratinocyte markers (IVL and P63) at both mRNA and protein levels was more similar to native tissue in comparison with AM and no-treatment groups.

We took three synergistic approaches to address these issues by modifying the chemical microenvironment for the seeded cells. Instead of the commonly used fibronectin, we demonstrated that type I collagen (COL) coating, facilitated by polydopamine treatment, promoted cell infiltration into the fibrous scaffold and resulted in homogeneous distribution in one week. Sequential treatment with fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-β after cell infiltration enhanced cell proliferation and matrix deposition, with increased lysyl oxidase and decreased matrix metalloproteinase-1 expressions. Finally, lamination of the fibrous sheets with fibrin gel not only increased construct size, but further stimulated COL deposition and improved construct mechanical functionalities in combination with sequential growth factor supplementation.

Although various materials such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), polylactic acid, poly(glycolic acid), and polyethylene glycol hydrogels have been used as scaffolds for salivary gland tissue engineering, none of them is effective enough to closely recapitulate the branched structural complexity and heterogeneous cell population of native salivary glands. Instead of discovering new biomaterial candidates, we synthesized hyaluronic acid-catechol (HACA) conjugates to establish a versatile hyaluronic acid coating platform named ""NiCHE (nature-inspired catechol-conjugated hyaluronic acid environment)"" for boosting the salivary gland tissue engineering efficacy of the previously reported biomaterials. By mimicking hyaluronic acid-rich niche in the mesenchyme of embryonic submandibular glands (eSMGs) with NiCHE coating on substrates including polycarbonate membrane, stiff agarose hydrogel, and polycaprolactone scaffold, we observed significantly enhanced cell adhesion, vascular endothelial and progenitor cell proliferation, and branching of in vitro-cultured eSMGs. High mechanical stiffness of the substrate is known to inhibit eSMG growth, but the NiCHE coating significantly reduced such stiffness-induced negative effects, leading to successful differentiation of progenitor cells to functional acinar and myoepithelial cells. These enhancement effects of the NiCHE coating were due to the increased proliferation of vascular endothelial cells via interaction between CD44 and surface-immobilized HAs. As such, our NiCHE coating platform renders any kind of material highly effective for salivary gland tissue culture by mimicking in vivo embryonic mesenchymal HA. Based on our results, we expect the NiCHE coating to expand the range of biomaterial candidates for salivary glands and other branching epithelial organs.","","Parsial","0.00","1944-8252","12","4"

The response of these cells to the biomaterial depends both on the local microenvironment and on the characteristics of the inserted bone substitute. In this work, bone allografts impregnated with albumin are loaded with a co-culture of human MSCs and monocytes; bone granules without albumin are used for comparison. Co-cultures are contextually treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines to simulate the inflammatory milieu naturally present during the bone regeneration process. As revealed by microscopic images, albumin-impregnated bone granules promote adhesion and interactions between cells populations. Compared to control granules, albumin coating diminishes reactive species production by cells. This reduced oxidative stress may be attributable to antioxidant properties of albumin, and it is also reflected in the mitigated gene expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes, where most intracellular reactive molecules are generated. MSCs-monocytes co-cultured onto albumin-impregnated bone granules additionally release higher amounts of immunomodulatory cytokines and growth factors.

To circumvent these limitations, a core-shell SF on rice paper (SF@RP) fibrous scaffold was fabricated using a mild one-step dip-coating method. The cellulose fiber matrix of RP is the physical basis of the 3D scaffold, whereas the SF coating on the cellulose fiber controls the adhesion/spreading of the cells. The results indicated that by tuning the secondary structure of SF on the surface of a SF@RP scaffold, the cell behavior on SF@RP could be tuned. Tumor spheroids can be formed on SF@RP scaffolds with a dominant random secondary structure, in contrast to cells adhering and spreading on SF@RP scaffolds with a higher ratio of β-sheet secondary structures. Direct culturing of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, lung cancer A549, prostate cancer DU145, and liver cancer HepG2 cells could spontaneously lead to corresponding tumor spheroids on SF@RP.

Although injectable materials are preferred for minimally invasive delivery, conventional macroporous scaffolds were not injectable and do not support homogeneous cell encapsulation. We recently reported a gelatin-based microribbon (μRB) scaffold that offers macroporosity while also supporting homogeneous cell encapsulation. Compared to conventional gelatin hydrogels, macroporous gelatin μRB scaffolds demonstrated great advantage in enhancing mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based cartilage formation. However, whether gelatin-based μRBs support MSC osteogenesis and bone formation remains unknown. The goal of this study is to assess the potential of gelatin-based μRBs for supporting MSC-based osteogenesis and bone formation in vitro. Given recent evidence from the literature that osteogenesis is sensitive to substrate stiffness, we further investigate how varying μRB stiffness modulates MSC osteogenesis. We first determine the maximal stiffness range of gelatin μRBs that can be fabricated (13-57 kPa), which supports both retention of μRB shape and macroporosity within scaffolds after inter-cross-linking. Interestingly, varying μRB stiffness across a broad range of stiffness did not significantly impact osteogenesis, with all groups supporting upregulation of bone markers and extensive collagen deposition. All gelatin μRBs also supported a comparable level of cell spreading and upregulation of mechanosensing markers. However, soft μRB (13 kPa) scaffolds did not maintain structural integrity and condensed into a pellet over time. Both intermediate and stiff gelatin μRB-based scaffolds maintained their integrity and supported robust bone formation, leading to a more than 10-fold increase in the compressive moduli of engineered bone after 5 weeks of culture in osteogenic media. Incorporating hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticle coating onto the gelatin μRB surface further accelerated the maturation of MSCs into osteoblasts and mineralization. Together, these results validate that gelatin μRBs can support MSC osteogenesis across a broad range of stiffness and offers an injectable macroporous scaffold for enhancing stem-cell-based bone regeneration.","","Parsial","0.00","2373-9878","6","6"

In this study, a bioactive PPC/laponite (LAP) nanocomposite (PL) was prepared by a melt-blending method, and a microporous surface on PPC and PL (PT and PLT) was created by sodium hydroxide (NaOH) treatment. The results demonstrated that the surface roughness, hydrophilicity, surface energy, and degradability as well as protein adsorption of PLT were obviously improved compared with PPC. Moreover, the degradability of PLT was remarkably enhanced with a slight increase of pH values in Tris-HCl solution. Furthermore, adhesion and proliferation as well as osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) to PLT were significantly promoted compared with PPC. The results suggested that incorporating LAP into PPC obviously improved the surface performance of PL (with nanotopography), and surface treatment with NaOH further enhanced surface properties of PLT (with micronanotopography and hydrophilic groups), which significantly promoted responses of rBMSCs. In short, PLT displayed excellent cytocompatibility, which would have great potential for bone regeneration.","","Parsial","0.00","2373-9878","6","1"

Even magnesium (Mg) has been shown to constitute a favorable biomaterial for the development of stabilizing structures. However, it has been described that it is necessary to prevent premature degradation to ensure both the functionality and the biocompatibility of such Mg implants. Different coating strategies have already been developed, but most of them did not provide the desired functionality. The present study analyses a new approach based on ion implantation (II) with PVD coating for the passivation of a newly developed Mg membrane for GBR/GTR procedures. To demonstrate comprehensive biocompatibility and successful passivation of the Mg membranes, untreated Mg (MG) and coated Mg (MG-Co) were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Thereby a collagen membrane with an already shown biocompatibility was used as control material. All investigations were performed according to EN ISO 10993 regulations. The in vitro results showed that both the untreated and PVD-coated membranes were not cytocompatible. However, both membrane types fulfilled the requirements for in vivo biocompatibility. Interestingly, the PVD coating did not have an influence on the gas cavity formation compared to the uncoated membrane, but it induced lower numbers of anti-inflammatory macrophages in comparison to the pure Mg membrane and the collagen membrane. In contrast, the pure Mg membrane provoked an immune response that was fully comparable to the collagen membrane. Altogether, this study shows that pure magnesium membranes represent a promising alternative compared to the nonresorbable volume-stable materials for GBR/GTR therapy.","","Ya","0.00","2227-9059","8","12"

Therefore, engineering the bone-ligament interface requires a biomaterial substrate capable of maintaining or directing the spatially defined differentiation of multiple cell phenotypes. To date the appropriate combination of biophysical and biochemical factors that can be used to engineer such a biomaterial substrate remain unknown. Here we show that microfiber scaffolds functionalized with tissue-specific extracellular matrix (ECM) components can direct the differentiation of MSCs toward the phenotypes seen at the bone-ligament interface. Ligament-ECM (L-ECM) promoted the expression of the ligament-marker gene tenomodulin (TNMD) and higher levels of type I and III collagen expression compared to functionalization with commercially available type I collagen. Functionalization of microfiber scaffolds with cartilage-ECM (C-ECM) promoted chondrogenesis of MSCs, as evidenced by adoption of a round cell morphology and increased SRY-box 9 (SOX9) expression in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Next, we fabricated a multiphasic scaffold by controlling the spatial presentation of L-ECM and C-ECM along the length of a single electrospun microfiber construct, with the distal region of the C-ECM coated fibers additionally functionalized with an apatite layer (using simulated body fluid) to promote endochondral ossification. These ECM functionalized scaffolds promoted spatially defined differentiation of MSCs, with higher expression of TNMD observed in the region functionalized with L-ECM, and higher expression of type X collagen and osteopontin (markers of endochondral ossification) observed at the end of the scaffold functionalized with C-ECM and the apatite coating. Our results demonstrate the utility of tissue-specific ECM derived components as a cue for directing MSC differentiation when engineering complex multiphasic interfaces such as the bone-ligament enthesis.","","Parsial","0.00","2373-9878","6","9"

Moreover, these cationic liposomes can also be used as a polycationic entity in multilayer formation using layer-by-layer technique (LbL), which is a method to fabricate surface coatings by alternating adsorption of polyanions and polycations. Since liposomes are suitable for endocytosis by or fusion with cells, controlled release of their cargo on site is possible. Here, a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) system was designed of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and collagen type I (Col I) by LbL technique with OO4/DOPE liposomes embedded in the terminal layers to create an osteogenic microenvironment. Both, the composition of PEM and cargo of the liposomes were used to promote osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts as in vitro model. The internalization of cargo-loaded liposomes from the PEM into C2C12 cells was studied using lipophilic (Rhodamine-DOPE conjugate) and hydrophilic (Texas Red-labeled dextran) model compounds. Besides, the use of Col I and CS should mimic the extracellular matrix of bone for future applications such as bone replacement therapies. Physicochemical studies of PEM were done to characterize the layer growth, thickness, and topography. The adhesion of myoblast cells was also evaluated whereby the benefit of a cover layer of CS and finally Col I above the liposome layer was demonstrated. As proof of concept, OO4/DOPE liposomes were loaded with dexamethasone, a compound that can induce osteogenic differentiation. A successful induction of osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells with the novel designed liposome-loaded PEM system was shown. These findings indicate that designed OH4/DOPE loaded PEMs have a high potential to be used as drug delivery or transfection system for implant coating in the field of bone regeneration and other applications.","","Parsial","0.00","2590-0064","7",""

However, this exploitation is largely restricted due to the potential of immunogenicity and virus contamination. Exploring new ways to produce human collagen is fundamental to its biomedical and clinical application. All human fibrillar collagen molecules have three polypeptide chains constructed from a repeating Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplet, where Xaa and Yaa represent one random amino acid. Using cDNA techniques to modify several repeat sequences of the cDNA fragment, a novel human collagen, named recombinant human-like collagen (rHLC), with low immunogenicity and little risk from hidden virus can be engineered and notably tailored to speciﬁc applications. Human-like collagen (HLC) was initially used as a coating to modify the tissue engineering scaffold, and then used as the scaffold after cross-link agents were added to increase its mechanical strength. Due to its good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, stabilised property, and the ability of mass production, HLC has been widely used in skin injury treatments, vascular scaffolds engineering, cartilage, bone defect repair, skincare, haemostatic sponge, and drug delivery, including coating with medical nanoparticles. In this review, we symmetrically reviewed the development, recent advances in design and application of HLC, and other recombinant human collagen-based biomedicine potentials.

In this work, a substrate-independent coating with on-demand release of an antifibrotic drug has been fabricated to effectively address this issue. This coating was formed through a substrate-independent layer-by-layer (LBL) technique via a cationic polyelectrolyte (poly-diallyldimethylammonium, PDDA) and an anionic polyelectrolyte (poly-styrenesulfonate, PSS), where parts of PSS and PDDA were physically replaced by carboxyl functionalized polyethylene glycol grafted onto antifibrotic drug dexamethasone (DEX-PEG-COOH). Considering the easy generation of local inflammation after implantation, an ester bond was designed between PEG-COOH and DEX. Therefore, the overexpressed esterase under inflammatory conditions hydrolyzes the ester bond and thereby releases DEX from the film to inhibit fibrosis occurring in the tissue repair process. The in vivo capacity of this coating to restrain tissue fibrosis was investigated by a skin defect model using porous polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds as substrates. The experimental results showed that the fibrosis-related proteins (Col-I, TGF-β and fibronectin) and the infiltration of myofibroblasts (α-SMA) of skin tissues in the coated PCL scaffold group were significantly lower than those in the blank control group and pure PCL scaffold group. Moreover, the histological evaluations showed that the coating group could significantly decrease the deposition of collagen and meanwhile promote the partial regeneration of skin appendages. These results successfully demonstrate that the universal coating prepared with a simple protocol would be an effective strategy to address the fibrosis issues during tissue engineering.","","Ya","0.00","2050-7518","8","34"

A higher voltage and a higher temperature led to a greater rate of mineralization. Furthermore, nearly linear calcium releasing kinetics was achieved from the mineralized 3D scaffolds. The releasing rate was controlled by varying the initial electrodeposition conditions. A higher deposition voltage and temperature led to slower calcium release, which was associated with the highly crystalline and stoichiometric hydroxyapatite content. This premineralized NF scaffold enhanced bone regeneration over the control scaffold in a subcutaneous implantation model, which was associated with released calcium ions in facilitating osteogenic cell proliferation.","","Parsial","0.00","1944-8252","12","29"

MTA was immersed in trishydroxymethyl aminomethane buffer with CA to allow coating onto MTA powders. X-ray diffractometry and tensile stress-strain tests were conducted to assess for physical characteristics of CAMTA and to evaluate for successful modification of MTA. Then, the CAMTA cement was immersed in simulated body fluid to evaluate its hydroxyapatite formation capabilities and Si release profiles. In addition, RAW 264.7 cells and human dental pulp stem cells were used to evaluate CAMTA's immunosuppressive capabilities and cell responses, respectively. hDPSCs were also used to assess CAMTA's angiogenic capabilities. The X-ray diffractometry results showed that CA can be successfully coated onto MTA without disrupting or losing MTA's original structural properties, thus allowing us to retain the initial advantages of MTA. CAMTA was shown to have higher mechanical properties compared with MTA and had rougher pitted surfaces, which were hypothesized to lead to enhanced adhesion, proliferation, and secretion of angiogenic- and odontogenic-related proteins. In addition, it was found that CAMTA was able to enhance hydroxyapatite formation and immunosuppressive capabilities compared with MTA. CAMTA cements were found to have improved physicochemical and biological characteristics compared with their counterpart. In addition, CAMTA cements had enhanced odontogenic, angiogenic, and immunosuppressive properties compared with MTA.

Poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF) is the piezoelectric polymer with the largest piezoelectric coefficients, being a perfect candidate for osteogenic differentiation. As a first approach, in this paper, we propose PVDF membranes containing magnetostrictive nanoparticles and a biomimetic heparin/collagen layer-by-layer (LbL) coating for mesenchymal stem cell culture. PVDF membranes 20% (w/v) with and without cobalt ferrite oxide (PVDF-CFO) 10% (w/w) were produced by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS).

Homogeneous ACP precipitation was induced in situ within the sponges by a temperature-controlled coating process composed of two steps. In the first step, the CaP solution was cooled to 4 °C to suppress precipitation until the solution penetrated fully into the sponge's internal pores. In the second step, the CaP solution was warmed up to 25 °C with continuous shaking to induce ACP precipitation within the sponges.

The coating is a frame structure of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) in a collagen matrix, which is formed by layer-by-layer solidification of an aqueous dispersion of SWCNT with collagen during spin coating and controlled irradiation with IR radiation. Quantum mechanical method SCC DFTB, with a self-consistent charge, was used. It is based on the density functional theory and the tight-binding approximation. The method established the optimal temperature and time for the formation of the equilibrium configurations of the SWCNT/collagen type II complexes to ensure maximum binding energies between the nanotube and the collagen. The highest binding energies were observed in complexes with SWCNT nanometer diameter in comparison with subnanometer SWCNT. The coating had a porous structure-pore size was 0.5-6 μm. The process of reducing the mass and volume of the coating with the initial biodegradation of collagen after contact with blood plasma was demonstrated. This is proved by exceeding the intensity of the SWCNT peaks G and D after contact with the blood serum in the Raman spectrum and by decreasing the intensity of the main collagen bands in the SWCNT/collagen complex frame coating. The number of pores and their size increased to 20 μm. The modification of the PET tape with the SWCNT/collagen coating allowed to increase its hydrophilicity by 1.7 times compared to the original PET fibers and by 1.3 times compared to the collagen coating. A reduced hemolysis level of the PET tape coated with SWCNT/collagen was achieved. The SWCNT/collagen coating provided 2.2 times less hemolysis than an uncoated PET implant. MicroCT showed the effective formation of new bone and dense connective tissue around the implant. A decrease in channel diameter from 2.5 to 1.7 mm was detected at three and, especially, six months after implantation of a PET tape with SWCNT/collagen coating. MicroCT allowed us to identify areas for histological sections, which demonstrated the favorable interaction of the PET tape with the surrounding tissues. In the case of using the PET tape coated with SWCNT/collagen, more active growth of connective tissue with mature collagen fibers in the area of implantation was observed than in the case of only collagen coating. The stimulating effect of SWCNT/collagen on the formation of bone trabeculae around and inside the PET tape was evident in three and six months after implantation. Thus, a PET tape with SWCNT/collagen coating has osteoconductivity as well as a high level of hydrophilicity and hemocompatibility.","","Ya","0.00","1422-0067","21","17"
