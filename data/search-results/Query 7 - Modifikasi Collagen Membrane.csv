The present study shows a new development in this technique, which involves modifying the design of the absorbable membrane and using pins to fix the membrane. This study concluded that the novel design of the collagen membrane and its fixation with the pins led to greater stability of the bone graft and led to subsequent bone gain that enables dental implantation. Still, this technique requires a histological study to determine the nature of the bone formed.","",""

In this case, surgically facilitated orthodontic treatment (SFOT) was proposed to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement while modifying the periodontal phenotype. An orthodontic patient was referred for periodontal evaluation of lower anterior teeth, which presented a thin gingival phenotype and bone dehiscence. SFOT was performed on the mandible using particulate allograft combined with platelet rich fibrin (PRF) and collagen membrane to augment soft and hard tissue, thereby preventing future recessions, while accelerating the treatment times. Six-month and 3-year follow-ups confirmed radiographic bone fill, absence of gingival recession and thick band of keratinized gingiva. SFOT also resulted in a shorter treatment time where desired tooth movements were achieved within 6 months with periodontal stability. SFOT provided clinical benefits by accelerating orthodontic movement, improving periodontal phenotype, preventing the displacement of teeth beyond the alveolar housing and minimizing the risk for development of dehiscences and gingival recessions. Orthodontic movements can create recessions and dehiscence in thin periodontal phenotypes. SFOT can help prevent bone dehiscence and creates a thicker gingival phenotype while accelerating treatment time. Adults who face lengthy orthodontic treatments and have thin gums have risks of gum problems. Surgically facilitated orthodontic treatment (SFOT) can help by speeding up tooth movements and improving gum health and thickness. A patient with thin gums and lack of bone in the lower front teeth was evaluated. The SFOT procedure involved using a bone graft, healing factors, and a collagen membrane to strengthen the gums and bones. This approach aimed to prevent future gum problems and speed up orthodontic treatment. Follow-ups at 6 months and 3 years after treatment showed good healing of the gums and bones, with no signs of gum recession and healthier, thicker gums. The desired tooth movements were achieved within 6 months, resulting in a shorter treatment time. The patient's gums remained stable throughout this period. SFOT offered significant clinical benefits, including faster tooth movement and improved gum health. It also helped prevent teeth from moving out of place and minimized the risk of gum recession and bone issues. This approach can be a valuable option for adults with thin gums undergoing orthodontic treatment.","",""

Forty healthy patients in need for oral rehabilitation with dental implants were included in this study. Inclusion criterion was the need for extraction of one compromised tooth due to persistent abscess/ periodontitis/cyst in the atrophic posterior maxilla region. The treatment consisted of two stage surgery for all patients. In the first stage, after tooth extraction, the sockets were preserved with allogenic bone graft and equine collagen membrane. After 4-5 months, 40 implants with a sandblasted surface, were inserted with osseodensification technique and a modification of the Summers sinus lift protocol for fracturing the sinus floor. The implant survival rate was the primary outcome. Intra- and postoperative complications were additional criteria for success. The mean follow-up from implant surgery was 28.0±7.3 (standard deviation) months (range 17.8-43.4 months). One implant was lost before the delivery of the prosthesis. The overall implant survival rate was 97.5%. The overall mean peri-implant marginal bone level change after 6 and 12 months of function was, respectively, 0.26±0.24 mm (95% CI: 0.19, 0.34 mm) and 0.71±0.36 mm (95% CI: 0.60, 0.82 mm). Marginal bone loss was statistically significant at both time frames respect to implant placement, and also the difference between 6 and 12 months was significant (p<0.001 in both cases). No biological nor mechanical complications were recorded throughout the observation period. As a conclusion, the technique presented in this cohort study can be an effective and safe alternative to standard maxillary sinus floor augmentation procedures and immediate implant insertion protocol, especially in cases of periodontitis and infected sites, which can represent a high risk for implant failure in patients with atrophic posterior maxilla.","",""

Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) addresses these defects using barrier membranes that block soft tissue infiltration and promote bone growth. CollaTape®, a type I bovine collagen membrane, is widely used for its biocompatibility and resorbability, though its bioactivity and antibacterial properties could be improved. This study compares two functionalization methods for enhancing CollaTape® membranes: adsorption of GBMP1α peptide (a BMP-2 biomimetic) and covalent anchoring of its analogue Aoa-GBMP1α. Both functionalizations were performed at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/mL. Optimal conditions were selected basing on osteoblast mineralization assays and resulted to be 0.25 mg/mL for adsorption and 1.5 mg/mL for covalent binding. Peptide surface density analysis revealed values of 0.040 μmol/cm² for adsorption and 0.278 μmol/cm² for covalent anchoring. Biological assays assessed mineralization, proliferation, and gene expression (SPP1, RUNX2) in human osteoblasts, and antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. All functionalized membranes improved osteoblast activity, with adsorption showing superior results. Antibacterial tests showed slight but significant reductions in bacterial colonies, especially for adsorption. Additional mechanical tests via unconfined compression were performed to evaluate the effect of functionalization on the membranes' mechanical properties. These tests confirmed that neither functionalization method compromised the stiffness of the membrane, a critical parameter in clinical applications. Overall, peptide adsorption is a simple and clinically adaptable strategy to enhance CollaTape®'s bioactivity and antibacterial properties while maintaining their original mechanical properties.&#xD.","",""

Such collagen constructs are widely used as barrier membranes in guided tissue and bone regeneration, where controlled degradation is essential for maintaining function. Although conventional crosslinking methods extend stability, they may introduce cytotoxicity, alter mechanical behavior, or hinder tissue integration. This study evaluated whether incorporating L-serine, a polar amino acid capable of hydrogen bonding, could modulate collagen structure and slow degradation without chemical crosslinking. L-Serine was selected because its hydroxyl-containing side chain can engage in biocompatible, hydrogen-bond-mediated interactions that offer a mild, non-crosslinking means of stabilizing collagen. Collagen scaffolds, prepared by incorporating L-serine into a collagen hydrogel followed by drying, were produced with 0-40 wt% L-serine and characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and scanning electron microscopy. In vivo degradation was assessed in a subcutaneous mouse model comparing unmodified collagen, collagen containing 40 wt% L-serine, and a commercially available bilayer porcine collagen membrane (Bio-Gide®, composed of type I and III collagen), with residual area quantified by serial sonography and histological evaluation. Low-to-moderate L-serine incorporation preserved triple-helical features, while 40 wt% led to crystalline domain formation and β-sheet enrichment. L-serine-treated collagen exhibited significantly greater residual area (2.70 ± 1.45 mm2) than unmodified collagen (0.37 ± 0.22 mm2, p < 0.05), although Bio-Gide® remained the most persistent (5.64 ± 2.76 mm2). These findings demonstrate that L-serine incorporation can modulate collagen structure and degradation kinetics through a simple, aqueous, and non-crosslinking approach. The results provide preliminary feasibility data supporting amino acid-assisted tuning of collagen resorption properties and justify further evaluation using membrane-specific fabrication and application-relevant testing.","",""

Transcriptomic changes following xHyA treatment were also investigated. SaOS-2 cells were cultured on NPCM and RCCM, with or without xHyA functionalization. Cytocompatibility, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mineralization (Von Kossa staining), and RNA sequencing were assessed. Differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted on cells exposed to two xHyA concentrations. Both membrane types supported cell viability, though NPCM allowed cellular infiltration while RCCM maintained barrier integrity. xHyA significantly enhanced ALP activity and mineral deposition across both substrates. RNA sequencing revealed minimal upregulation of classical osteogenic genes but identified differential expression in pathways related to focal adhesion, VEGF signaling, and stem cell differentiation. IGF1R, FYN, and MAPK14 were consistently upregulated regardless of xHyA concentration. xHyA functionalization enhances osteogenic activity, evidenced by increased ALP and mineralization, likely via modulation of cell-matrix interactions rather than classical osteogenic gene activation. These findings support using xHyA-functionalized membranes in GBR and warrant further investigation in vivo.","",""

A novel carp collagen sponge has already shown promise as a wound coating and vascular graft coating, making it a candidate for GBR applications as well. To enhance the mechanical properties and longevity of GBR membranes, we modified the basic carp collagen membrane with combinations of l-lactide, ε-caprolactone, d,l-lactide, and glycolide in various molar ratios. While traditional methods rely on histological evaluation to assess the degradation pattern and therefore suitability of GBR membranes ex vivo, this study employed micro-MRI as an innovative, noninvasive approach to monitor the in vivo degradation of carp collagen membrane and its polymer-modified variants. Our findings demonstrated that micro-MRI is a reliable and effective method for visualizing collagen membrane degradation in vivo, up to scaffold disintegration. Among the variants tested, collagen GBR membrane coated with d,l-lactide and glycolide in a 50:50 M ratio emerged as the most suitable for GBR purposes. However, since this study was conducted in the subcutaneous tissue of a rat model, further research is required to determine the behavior of carp collagen GBR membrane variants on bony surfaces.","",""

Three patients with significant horizontal defects were treated with pre-trimmed TFs to create needed space, and then a 50/50 mixture of autograft and bovine xenograft was placed and covered with a collagen membrane. After 8 months of healing, the sites were reopened, and the titanium screws were removed with the frame.

In this study, a modified collagen membrane with a polydopamine-graphene oxide (PDA/GO) complex was synthesized to improve the characteristics of collagen for bone tissue engineering. The successful synthesis of PDA/GO on collagen membranes was verified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The wettability of PDA/GO-modified collagen membranes was considerably improved based on the characterization by water contact angle compared to the uncoated membranes and surface coatings solely by either PDA or GO. The modified PDA/GO coating also enhanced the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and biodegradation rate of collagen membranes. In addition, the PDA/GO coating effectively enhanced the biocompatibility of collagen membranes as verified by the enhanced proliferation and adhesion of human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs). Additionally, the effects of PDA/GO coating on the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs on collagen membranes were investigated through alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

To demonstrate comprehensive biocompatibility and successful passivation of the Mg membranes, untreated Mg (MG) and coated Mg (MG-Co) were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Thereby a collagen membrane with an already shown biocompatibility was used as control material. All investigations were performed according to EN ISO 10993 regulations. The in vitro results showed that both the untreated and PVD-coated membranes were not cytocompatible. However, both membrane types fulfilled the requirements for in vivo biocompatibility. Interestingly, the PVD coating did not have an influence on the gas cavity formation compared to the uncoated membrane, but it induced lower numbers of anti-inflammatory macrophages in comparison to the pure Mg membrane and the collagen membrane. In contrast, the pure Mg membrane provoked an immune response that was fully comparable to the collagen membrane. Altogether, this study shows that pure magnesium membranes represent a promising alternative compared to the nonresorbable volume-stable materials for GBR/GTR therapy.","",""

The ABBM-C and CM were functionalized with either anti-BMP-2 mAb (test group) or an isotype matched control mAb (control group). Animals were euthanized at 12 weeks for radiographic, histologic, and histomorphometric analyses. Outcomes were compared between groups. 3D imaging using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) revealed that sites treated with ABBM-C and CM functionalized with anti-BMP-2 mAb exhibited significantly more remaining bone width near the alveolar crest, as well as buccal bone height, compared with control groups. Histologic and histomorphometric analyses demonstrated that in anti-BMP-2 mAb-treated sites, total tissue volume was significantly higher in the coronal part of the alveolar bone crest compared with control sites. In anti-BMP-2 mAb-treated sites, bone formation was observed under the barrier membrane. Functionalization of the ABBM-C scaffold and CM appeared to have led to bone formation within healing alveolar bone sockets.","",""

In this Technical Note, we describe a modification of the NAMIC procedure using mosaicplasty trephines to prepare the lesion surface and to shape collagen implants in an all-arthroscopic approach (A-NAMIC). This technique is indicated for the treatment of International Cartilage Repair Society grade III to IV knee chondral lesions of ≤4 cm2. After damaged cartilage is debrided, trephines are used to create a flat, circular lesion surfaces. Subsequently, BMS is performed with nanofracture, eliciting reproducible and stop-controlled subchondral bone perforations of 9-mm depth and 1-mm width. The collagen membrane is then cut to size with the trephine, placed over the prepared defect, and secured with fibrin glue, preventing loss of regenerating cells and growth factors to the joint space. Using trephines allows the rapid and precise creation of smooth defect surfaces with known dimensions, ensuring optimal lesion coverage. Additionally, nanofracture reduces trabecular compaction and allows for a deeper access to subchondral bone in comparison with conventional microfracture, improving lesion filling and production of cartilage with higher hyaline content.","",""

Twenty-eight mice underwent implantation of three commercially available CM derived from porcine dermis (homogenous structure: CM1 (Control 1) and bilayer structure: CM2 [Control 2]), from porcine pericardium (CM3; Test 1) as well as CM3 sprayed with silica-enhanced nanostructured hydroxyapatite (CM4, Test 2). After 3, 6, 9, and 12 days, intravital fluorescence microscopy was conducted for determination of capillary diameter, density, flow, and length. At Day 12, samples were examined immunohistologically for expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), CD11b, CD68, αSMA, and CD34. In all CM, intravital fluorescence microscopy over time showed increasing values for all parameters with the highest levels in CM4 and the lowest values in CM1. Significant lower amounts of FGFR4, CD11b, and CD68 were detected in CM4 when compared to CM2 (p < .05). In contrast to CM3, lower values of αSMA and higher numbers of CD34 positive-marked vessels were observed in CM4 (p < .05). In conclusion, dermal bilayer as well as pericardial CM seem to have a higher vascularization rate than dermal homogenous CM. Additional coating of pericardial CM with a silica-enhanced hydroxyapatite increases the speed of vascularization as well as biological remodeling processes.","",""

This study evaluated the efficacy and biocompatibility of BCP-supplemented UV-crosslinked collagen membrane for guided bone regeneration (GBR) in a rabbit calvarial model. Four circular bone defects (diameter, 8 mm) were created in the calvarium of 10 rabbits. Each defect was randomly allocated to one of the following groups: 1) the sham control group (spontaneous healing); 2) the M group (defect coverage with a BCP-supplemented UV-crosslinked collagen membrane and no graft material); 3) the BG (defects filled with BCP particles without membrane coverage); and 4) the BG+M group (defects filled with BCP particles and covered with a BCP-supplemented UV-crosslinked collagen membrane in a conventional GBR procedure). At 2 and 8 weeks, rabbits were sacrificed, and experimental defects were investigated histologically and by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). In both micro-CT and histometric analyses, the BG and BG+M groups at both 2 and 8 weeks showed significantly higher new bone formation than the control group. On micro-CT, the new bone volume of the BG+M group (48.39±5.47 mm3) was larger than that of the BG group (38.71±2.24 mm3, P=0.032) at 8 weeks. Histologically, greater new bone area was observed in the BG+M group than in the BG or M groups. BCP-supplemented UV-crosslinked collagen membrane did not cause an abnormal cellular reaction and was stable until 8 weeks. Enhanced new bone formation in GBR can be achieved by simultaneously using bone graft material and a BCP-supplemented UV-crosslinked collagen membrane, which showed high biocompatibility and resistance to degradation, making it a biocompatible alternative to chemically-crosslinked collagen membranes.","",""

Six randomly selected pigs were sacrificed after 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Specimens were histologically and histomorphometrically analysed focusing on newly formed bone (NFB), demineralized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) and soft tissue (ST) proportions. Four weeks after defect preparation, no statistically significant difference concerning NFB quantity could be detected within the groups. Defects covered with the CM showed lower amounts of DBBM. After 6 and 12 weeks, defects augmented with DBBM in combination with a CM (8 weeks: 43.12 ± 4.31; 12 weeks: 43.05 ± 3.01) showed a statistically significant higher NFB rate compared to empty control defects covered with 8 weeks: 7.66 ± 0.59; 12 weeks or without a CM; 8 weeks: 8.62 ± 2.66; 12 weeks: 18.40 ± 2.40. CM application showed no significant impact on osseous defect regeneration or soft tissue formation. Superior NFB could be detected for basal aspect for several evaluation time points. The modification of CSD with titanium tubes represents a suitable model to imitate a one-wall defect regeneration situation. The established model represents a promising method to evaluate graft consolidation in one-wall defect configuration.","",""

Two experimental sites on each side of the animals were prepared using an extraoral approach for maxillary sinus wall. The four treatments were performed in each animal through a standardized 10-mm access window. While the BBM access was covered with a collagen membrane, all other sites were closed with an equine collagen membrane. All animals were euthanized after 16 weeks. New bone (NB), residual graft particles, and connective tissue were measured in undemineralized resin-embedded sections. As a result, one sheep did not survive the surgery. All sites in the remaining 10 sheep healed uneventfully. All CC and BBM-PCC grafts resorbed and failed to augment the sinuses. BBM and CC-BCP, in contrast, showed some histologic evidence of NB and surgical site augmentation. The NB fraction in the latter two groups accounted for 10 ± 9 and 4 ± 5%, respectively (p > 0.05). In conclusion, BBM-PCC and collagen cone performed poorly for sinus floor augmentation, while deproteinised BBM and reinforced collagen cone demonstrated comparable outcomes.","",""
