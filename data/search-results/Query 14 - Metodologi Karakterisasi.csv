Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) addresses these defects using barrier membranes that block soft tissue infiltration and promote bone growth. CollaTape®, a type I bovine collagen membrane, is widely used for its biocompatibility and resorbability, though its bioactivity and antibacterial properties could be improved. This study compares two functionalization methods for enhancing CollaTape® membranes: adsorption of GBMP1α peptide (a BMP-2 biomimetic) and covalent anchoring of its analogue Aoa-GBMP1α. Both functionalizations were performed at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/mL. Optimal conditions were selected basing on osteoblast mineralization assays and resulted to be 0.25 mg/mL for adsorption and 1.5 mg/mL for covalent binding. Peptide surface density analysis revealed values of 0.040 μmol/cm² for adsorption and 0.278 μmol/cm² for covalent anchoring. Biological assays assessed mineralization, proliferation, and gene expression (SPP1, RUNX2) in human osteoblasts, and antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. All functionalized membranes improved osteoblast activity, with adsorption showing superior results. Antibacterial tests showed slight but significant reductions in bacterial colonies, especially for adsorption. Additional mechanical tests via unconfined compression were performed to evaluate the effect of functionalization on the membranes' mechanical properties. These tests confirmed that neither functionalization method compromised the stiffness of the membrane, a critical parameter in clinical applications. Overall, peptide adsorption is a simple and clinically adaptable strategy to enhance CollaTape®'s bioactivity and antibacterial properties while maintaining their original mechanical properties.&#xD.","",""

By investigating the impact of gradient ambient temperature on performance, it is highlighted that cathode catalyst layer hydration deeply affects proton conduction in the membrane and three-phase boundary formation. These issues consequently increase ohmic resistance and cathode activation resistance as seen via polarization curve comparison and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis method, ultimately degrading overall stack voltage output under the same current density. Under indoor temperature and humidity conditions, an orthogonal experiment was designed to validate the sensitivity analysis on the cathode I/C ratio (0.74-0.9) and catalyst layer thickness (8, 12 μm) by controlling the catalyst-coated membrane manufacture process; GDL thickness (185-324 μm) and pore structure were also investigated, combining parameter characterization techniques like MIP and BET. It is shown that with an I/C ratio of 0.86, a medium GDL pore structure and a higher catalyst layer thickness of 12 μm bring better performance output, especially when the OC PEMFC is 700 mA/cm2 @ 0.62 V.","",""

Berberine (BBR) has been reported to inhibit fibrosis and promote bone regeneration, yet it remains unclear whether BBR can simultaneously suppress fibroblast activity while enhancing osteogenic differentiation. This study aims to identify the optimal BBR concentration and its dual mechanisms in inhibiting fibroblast proliferation while promoting osteogenic differentiation, potentially providing an alternative to the barrier function of traditional GBR membranes. The optimal BBR concentration and its effects on fibroblast proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were evaluated in vitro. Network pharmacology and proteomics were used to investigate the potential mechanisms. A rat model of alveolar bone defects was used to evaluate the reparative effect of BBR. Seahorse analysis, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence were employed to explore BBR's regulatory effect on mitochondrial function in both cell types. BBR at 10 and 15 μM optimally promotes osteoblast dominance within the wound healing microenvironment, induces G1-phase arrest in fibroblasts, and promotes osteogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, BBR directly binds to prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2) and upregulates Ptgs2 to achieve the dual effects. In vivo, the bone regeneration effect of the BBR and Bio-Oss® (a commercial bone substitute) combination was similar to that of the Bio-Oss® and Bio-Gide® combination (a commercial collagen membrane). Furthermore, distinct COX-2 localization patterns were observed following BBR treatment, with enhanced mitochondrial localization in osteoblasts and nuclear localization in fibroblasts, coupled with altered mitochondrial energy metabolism. Our study suggests that optimal concentrations of BBR can inhibit fibroblast proliferation and promote osteogenic differentiation, thereby enhancing bone regeneration. Combined with spatial maintenance materials, BBR presents a promising alternative to traditional GBR membranes for improving clinical outcomes in oral bone augmentation and defect repair.","",""

There were four experimental groups: PVA/SF, 1BCP/PVA/SF, 3BCP/PVA/SF, and 5BCP/PVA/SF. All fabricated membranes appeared white in color with a smooth texture; however, SEM images revealed a rougher top surface compared to the bottom surface.

The current study aimed to introduce coated nanoporous membranes for localized drug delivery of donepezil, combining both antifouling activity and sustained drug release, unlike traditional Alzheimer's treatments that rely on systemic administration. Nanoporous membranes were prepared by electrochemical anodization, coated with Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or a PMMA/polyurethane (PU) mixture to mitigate biofouling. The fabricated nanoporous membranes before and after coating were characterized using SEM/EDX, FTIR, BET, and contact angle measurements. In vitro drug release and release kinetics were studied in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Coated and donepezil loaded membranes were implanted on the dura surface in Wistar rats AD model via intracerebral streptozotocin (STZ) injection. The activity was evaluated on behavioral, biochemical and histological levels. PMMA enhanced membrane hydrophobicity (contact angle increased from 62.8° to 79°) and sustained drug release over 7 days, making it the preferred coating. The PMMA membrane demonstrated a reduction in beta-amyloid levels without being loaded with donepezil, while the donepezil-loaded membrane showed cognitive function improvement in Morris water maze and Y-maze. Acetylcholinesterase activity was elevated after STZ-induction of AD and got ameliorated by the membranes implantation. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) was lowered by STZ, while increased in treated animals. Histological examination revealed the neuronal regeneration after donepezil-loaded PMMA coated membrane. These findings suggest that coated nanoporous membranes are promising systems for localized active donepezil drug delivery for AD-like symptoms modulation in STZ-induced AD model, warranting further validation in other AD paradigms.","",""

The CCM facilitates enhanced ionic and water transport between the cathode and the anion exchange membrane (AEM). This advantage is particularly significant with AEM water electrolysis (compared to proton exchange membrane water electrolysis) because the cathode typically operates under dry conditions and relies solely on diffusive water transport across the AEM from the liquid-fed anode. This study presents a direct performance comparison between CCS and CCM cathode configurations using identical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts and other components. The use of a pseudo-reference electrode integrated into the membrane electrode assembly enabled detailed analysis of the CCM cathode polarization behavior. Surface characterization provided insight into the degradation mechanisms associated with the CCM configuration. Optimization of the cathode ionomer cross-link density improved both the cathode polarization performance and the electrolysis device durability. Further optimization of the HER catalyst loading in the CCM cathode resulted in additional gains in the electrolysis efficiency. Collectively, these findings offer valuable guidance for the design and fabrication of high-performance, durable AEM electrolysis CCMs.","",""

Accurate and reproducible water uptake data are essential for guiding AEM design, yet conventional gravimetric methods-relying on manual blotting and loosely defined drying steps-can introduce variabilities exceeding 20%. Here, we present a standardized protocol that transforms water uptake measurements from rough estimates into precise, comparable ""hydration fingerprints."" By replacing manual wiping with a calibrated pressure-blotting rig (0.44 N cm-2 for 10 s twice) and verifying both dry and wet states via ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, we dramatically reduce scatter and align our FAAM-PK-75 (Fumatech, Bietigheim, Germany) results with published benchmarks in DI water, aqueous KOH (0.1-9 M), various alcohols, and controlled humidity (39-96% RH). These uptake profiles reveal how OH- screening, thermal densification at 60 °C, and PEEK reinforcement govern equilibrium hydration. A low-cost salt-bath method for vapor-phase sorption further distinguishes reinforced from unreinforced architectures. Extending the workflow to additional commercial and custom membranes confirms its broad applicability.

The impact of this radiation on collagen, a primary structural protein in humans, remains underexplored, particularly at varying doses and hydration states. This study explores the impact of ionizing radiation on type I collagen fibrils at three radiation doses (diagnostic, therapeutic, and sterilization) and under two hydration conditions using an engineered acellular collagen membrane to reflect varying biological conditions. Techniques including atomic force microscopy (AFM), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were utilized to assess changes in mechanical properties, biochemical stability, and molecular structure respectively. Our results demonstrate that ionizing radiation alters the mechanical properties of collagen fibrils, notably indentation modulus, which reflects changes in stiffness or elasticity. These modifications depended on the hydration state at the time of radiation exposure; hydrated fibrils typically exhibited increased stiffness, suggesting enhanced cross-linking, whereas dehydrated fibrils showed reduced stiffness, indicative of structural weakening, possibly due to bond breakdown. Morphological changes were minimal, suggesting that radiation primarily affects the internal structure rather than the overall appearance of the fibrils. Biochemically, variations in fluorescence lifetimes highlighted changes in the collagen's biochemical environment, dependent on the dose and hydration state. Despite these biochemical and mechanical changes, FTIR analysis indicated that the primary structure of collagen was largely preserved post-irradiation for all examined dose levels. These findings imply that radiation can modify the mechanical properties of collagen, potentially affecting tissue integrity in clinical settings. This could influence the management of radiation-induced conditions like osteoradionecrosis, fibrosis and cancer metastasis. Overall, our study underscores the need for further research into the effects of radiation on structural proteins to better understand and mitigate radiation-induced tissue damage.","",""

Additionally, after 14 days, PEU BM exhibited a higher expression of BGLAP/osteocalcin and superior in vivo performance-less inflammation and increased CD31 and VWF expression over time. When placed in critical-sized defects in the calvaria of rats, the PEU BM led to robust bone formation with high expression of osteogenesis and angiogenesis markers. Moreover, our membrane enhanced alveolar bone and cementum regeneration in an established periodontal model after 8 weeks. We demonstrate that the PEU BM exhibits favorable clinical properties, including mechanical stability, cytocompatibility, and facilitated bone formation in vitro and in vivo. This highlights its suitability for GBR in periodontal and craniofacial bone defects.","",""

The tests of antileishmanial activity and the AFM images demonstrate great efficacy of inhibition growth of the parasite, superior to those from the standard therapeutic agent that is currently used: Amphotericin B. The new membranes are biocompatible and stimulated the proliferation of keratinocytes. SEM images clearly demonstrate that fibroblasts were able to adhere, maintained their characteristic morphology. The healing test evidenced that the membranes have adequate environment for promoting cell proliferation and growth.

In this study, we propose a novel approach for chiral separation through a selector (bovine serum albumin, BSA) mediated thermo-sensitive membrane system.

The results demonstrate outstanding chiral separation efficiency, achieving αL/D = 3.30 for D-phenylalanine (D-Phe) rejection at 40 °C on a BSA-mediated PDTAN membrane system, with significant stability and minimal fouling, surpassing previous findings. Moreover, the PDTAN membrane altered the selective properties of recognition sites in BSA, transitioning from rejecting L-Phe to rejecting D-Phe. Analysis using fourth-order derivative UV-vis, circular dichroism (CD), and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques revealed a transition in the secondary structure of BSA from α-helix to β-sheet as the temperature increased. This transition, facilitated by hydrogen bonding between BSA and PNIPAm, enabled selective recognition of D-Phe, demonstrating a distinct shift in chiral recognition properties. Importantly, with D-Phe adsorbed onto β-sheet structures of BSA, hydrogen-bond interactions between BSA and the PDTAN membrane were significantly reduced, thereby minimizing membrane fouling and achieving the durability of membrane-based chiral separation.","",""

This study aimed to overcome the problems of batch culture using the controlled release concept by a controlled porosity osmotic pump (CPOP) system. The CPOP was formulated with glucose as a carbon source feeding and sodium carbonate as a pH modifier in the core of the tablet that was coated with a semipermeable membrane containing cellulose acetate and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400. The release rate was regulated with Eudragit L100 as a retardant agent in the core and PEG 400 as a pore-former agent in the coating membrane. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to elucidate compatibility between components and release mechanism, respectively. The in-vitro release of glucose and Na2CO3 studies were performed for 24 hours in a mineral culture medium (M9). Then, the effectiveness of CPOP in the growth of Escherichia coli (E. coliBL21) as a microorganism model was evaluated. Glucose consumption, changes in medium's pH, and acetate concentration as a by-product were also monitored during the bacterial growth. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the compatibility between the components in the osmotic pump, and SEM elucidated the release mechanism due to in-situ delivery pores created by dissolving soluble components (PEG 400) on the coated membrane upon contact with the dissolution medium. The in-vitro release studies indicated that the osmotic pump was able to deliver glucose and sodium carbonate in a zero-order manner. The use of CPOP in E. coli (BL21) cultivation resulted in a statistically significant improvement in biomass (over 80%), maintaining the pH of the medium (above 6.8) during the exponential phase, and reducing metabolic by-product formation (acetate), compared to bolus feeding (P < 0.05). The use of CPOP, which is capable of controlled release of glucose as a carbon source and sodium carbonate as a pH modifier, can overcome the drawbacks of bolus feeding, such as decreased pH, increased acetate concentration, and low productivity.

Thus, our aim is to prepare a novel biomimetic GTR membrane utilizing a natural biomaterial, soluble eggshell membrane protein (SEP), which is economical as it comes from an abundant industrial waste from food and poultry industries, unlike collagen. Additive polymer, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and a bioceramic, nano-hydroxyapatite (HAp), were added to improve its mechanical and biological properties. For this barrier membrane preparation, we initially screened the significant factors affecting its mechanical properties using Taguchi orthogonal array design and further optimized the significant factors using response surface methodology. Furthermore, this membrane was characterized using SEM, EDAX, and ATR-FTIR, and tested for proliferation activity of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPLFs). Optimization using response surface methodology predicted that the maximal tensile strength of 3.1 MPa and modulus of 39.9 MPa could be obtained at membrane composition of 8.9 wt% PLGA, 7.2 wt% of SEP, and 2 wt% HAp. Optimized PLGA/SEP/HAp membrane specimens that were electrospun on a static collector showed higher proliferation activity of HPLFs compared to tissue culture polystyrene and a commercial collagen membrane. From the results observed, we can conclude that SEP-based nanofibrous GTR membrane could be a promising, environment-friendly, and cost-effective alternative for commercial collagen-based GTR membrane products.","",""

Membrane fouling limits their wider use; however, this may be mitigated using photocatalytic composite materials for membrane preparation. This study aimed to investigate photocatalytic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-based nanocomposite membranes for treating model dairy wastewater containing bovine serum albumin (BSA). Membranes were fabricated via physical coating (with TiO2, and/or carbon nanotubes, and/or BiVO4) and blending (with TiO2). Another objective of this study was to compare membranes of identical compositions fabricated using different techniques, and to examine how various TiO2 concentrations affect the antifouling and cleaning performances of the blended membranes. Filtration experiments were performed using a dead-end cell. Filtration resistances, BSA rejection, and photocatalytic cleanability (characterized by flux recovery ratio (FRR)) were measured. The surface characteristics (SEM, EDX), roughness (measured by atomic force microscopy, AFM), wettability (contact angle measurements), and zeta potential of the membranes were also examined. Coated PVDF membranes showed higher hydrophilicity than the pristine PVDF membrane, as evidenced by a decreased contact angle, but the higher hydrophilicity did not result in higher fluxes, unlike the case of blended membranes. The increased surface roughness resulted in increased reversible fouling, but decreased BSA retention. Furthermore, the TiO2-coated membranes had a better flux recovery ratio (FRR, 97%) than the TiO2-blended membranes (35%). However, the TiO2-coated membrane had larger total filtration resistances and a lower water flux than the commercial pristine PVDF membrane and TiO2-blended membrane, which may be due to pore blockage or an additional coating layer formed by the nanoparticles. The BSA rejection of the TiO2-coated membrane was lower than that of the commercial pristine PVDF membrane. In contrast, the TiO2-blended membranes showed lower resistance than the pristine PVDF membrane, and exhibited better antifouling performance, superior flux, and comparable BSA rejection. Increasing the TiO2 content of the TiO2-blended membranes (from 1 to 2.5%) resulted in increased antifouling and comparable BSA rejection (more than 95%). However, the effect of TiO2 concentration on flux recovery was negligible.","",""

Collagen was crosslinked, respectively, by EDC/NHS and PRAs to form stable amide bonds and imine groups. Through the formation of a double interpenetrating network, dual-crosslinked (Col-EDC-PRA) membranes exhibited enhanced resistance to collagenase degradation and superior mechanical properties compared to membranes crosslinked with a single crosslinker. Furthermore, Col-EDC-PRA membranes display favorable light transmittance and water content characteristics. Cell experiments showed that Col-EDC-PRA membranes were noncytotoxic and were not significantly different from other membranes. In a rabbit keratoplasty model, corneal stromal repair occurred at 5 months, evidenced by the presence of stromal cells and neo-stroma, as depicted in hematoxylin-eosin-stained histologic sections and optical coherence tomography images of the anterior segment.

We present microporous membranes grafted with polyzwitterionic brushes (N-dimethylammonium betaine) that combine bacteriophage removal in the range of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with the permeance of MF membranes. Brush structures were grafted in two steps: free-radical polymerization followed by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) verified that grafting occurred at both sides of the membranes and that the grafting increased with increasing the zwitterion monomer concentration. The log reduction values (LRVs) of the pristine membrane increased from less than 0.5 LRV for T4 (∼100 nm) and NT1 (∼50 nm) bacteriophages to up to 4.5 LRV for the T4 and 3.1 LRV for the NT1 for the brush-grafted membranes with a permeance of about 1000 LMH/bar. The high permeance was attributed to a high-water fraction in the ultra-hydrophilic brush structure. The high measured LRVs of the brush-grafted membranes were attributed to enhanced bacteriophages exclusion from the membrane surface and entrapment of the ones that penetrated the pores due to the membranes' smaller mean pore-size and cross-section porosity than those of the pristine membrane, as seen by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and measured using liquid-liquid porometry. Micro X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) spectrometry and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry showed that 100 nm Si-coated gold nanospheres accumulated on the surface of the pristine membrane but not on the brush-coated membrane and that the nanospheres that penetrated the membranes were entrapped in the brush-grafted membrane but passed the pristine one. These results corroborate the LRVs obtained during filtration experiments and support the inference that the increased removal was due to a combined exclusion mechanism and entrapment. Overall, these microporous brush-grafted membranes show potential for use in advanced water treatment.","",""

The goal of this study was to compare microscopic, molecular, and mechanical properties of HFL and periosteum (HP) from a bone tissue engineering perspective. Material and Methods: Cadaveric HP and HFL (N = 4 each) microscopic morphology was characterized using histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the extracellular matrix (ECM) ultrastructure assessed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). DNA, collagen, elastin, glycosaminoglycans, major histocompatibility complex Type 1, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) contents were quantified. HP (N = 6) and HFL (N = 11) were submitted to stretch tests. Results: Histology and IHC highlighted similarities (Type I collagen fibers and two-layer organization) but also differences (fiber thickness and compaction and cell type) between both tissues, as confirmed using SEM. The collagen content was statistically higher in HFL than HP (735 vs. 160.2 μg/mg dry weight, respectively, p < 0.0001). On the contrary, DNA content was lower in HFL than HP (404.75 vs. 1,102.2 μg/mg dry weight, respectively, p = 0.0032), as was the immunogenic potential (p = 0.0033). BMP-2 and BMP-7 contents did not differ between both tissues (p = 0.132 and p = 0.699, respectively). HFL supported a significantly higher tension stress than HP. Conclusion: HP and HFL display morphological differences, despite their similar molecular ECM components. The stronger stretching resistance of HFL can specifically be explained by its higher collagen content. However, HFL contains many fewer cells and is less immunogenic than HP, as latter is rich in periosteal stem cells. In conclusion, HFL is likely suitable to replace HP architecture to confer a guide for bone consolidation, with an absence of osteogenicity. This study could pave the way to a bio-engineered periosteum built from HFL.","",""

Despite an increase in the release of inflammatory mediators by human circulating monocytes, the in vivo implantation of the functionalized membrane allowed the repair of a critical-sized defect in a calvaria rat model with de novo bone exhibiting physiological matrix composition and structural organization. Microtomography, histological and Raman analysis combined with nanoindentation testing revealed an increase in bone volume in the presence of the functionalized membrane and the formation of woven bone after eight weeks of implantation; these data showed the potential of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, chitosan and hyaluronic acid to induce an efficient repair of critical-sized bone defects and establish the importance of thorough multi-scale characterization in assessing biomaterial outcomes in animal models.","",""

Biomineralization is a process in which hydroxyapatite deposits mainly in collagen fibrils of the matrices. However, when this deposition occurs on the ECM, its mechanical properties are increased, facilitating bone regeneration. The objective of the present research is to ascertain if different membranes from distinct origins may undergo biomineralization. Nanomechanical properties, scanning electron (SEM) and multiphoton (MP) microscopy imaging were performed in three commercially available ECMs before and after immersion in simulated body fluid solution for 7 and 21 d. The matrices coming from porcine dermis increased their nanomechanical properties and they showed considerable mineralization after 21 d, as observed in structural changes detected through SEM and MP microscopy. It is hypothesized that the more abundant crosslinking and the presence of elastin fibers within this membrane explains the encountered favorable behavior.","",""

The total interface between the modified membrane and the pectin molecule was significantly greater than the pristine membrane.

The systematic characterization of adsorbed proteins on the gas exchange membrane of the lung system over time can provide insights into the course of various defence reactions and identify possible targets for surface modifications. Using comprehensive mass spectrometry analyses of desorbed proteins, we were able to identify for the first time binding profiles of over 500 proteins over a period of six hours on non-coated and heparin-coated PMP hollow fiber membranes. We observed a higher degree of remodeling of the protein layer on the non-coated membrane than on the coated membrane. In general, there was a higher protein binding on the coated membrane with exception of proteins with a heparin-binding site. Focusing on the most important pathways showed that almost all coagulation factors bound in higher amounts to the non-coated membranes. Furthermore, we could show that the initiator proteins of the complement system bound stronger to the heparinized membranes, but the subsequently activated proteins bound stronger to the non-coated membranes, thus complement activation on heparinized surfaces is mainly due to the alternative complement pathway.

In this study, the blow-spinning process and parameters were optimized to steadily fabricate collagen nanofibers by ejecting a collagen solution with constant airflow with precisely controlled diameter and alignment. Different from the electrospun collagen nanofibrous membrane, the blow-spun one was fluffy and spongy with high porosity. It was observed that the blow-spun collagen membrane could better maintain the fiber structure after chemical crosslinking in comparison with the electrospun membrane crosslinked in the same condition, which probably attributed to the good porosity and permeability of crosslinking agent within the membranes. The in vitro cell culture of Schwann cells on the blow-spun collagen nanofibrous spongy membrane showed its good biocompatibility for cell attachment, growth, and migration into the membrane, implying its potential in biomedical applications.

In conclusion, it was shown that the multi-layered collagen structure material had sufficient mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and osteogenic ability. Meanwhile, it is also shown that there is a gap in current clinical needs, between the guided tissue regeneration membrane and the one being used. Therefore, this study provides useful insights into the efforts being made to design and adjust the microstructure to balance its mechanical properties, degradation rate, and osteogenic activity.","",""

To address this problem, iron oxide ultrafiltration membranes were coated with poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (polySBMA), a superhydrophilic zwitterionic polymer. The ceramic-organic hybrid membrane was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical profilometry (OP). Membranes with and without polySBMA coating were subjected to fouling with bovine serum albumin solution. Hydraulic cleaning was significantly more effective for the coated membrane than for the non-coated one, as 56%, 66%, and 100% of the fouling was removed for the first, second, and third filtration cycle, respectively. Therefore, we can highlight the improved cleaning due to an increased fouling reversibility. Although some loss of polymer during operation was detected, it did not affect the improved behavior of the tested membranes.","",""

Collagenase plays an essential role in the invasion step in animals and humans. In this study, we characterized collagenase found in the nonpathogenic bacterium Lysinibacillus sphaericus VN3, which was isolated from soil in Vietnam. The collagenase activity of the purified enzyme was strongly inhibited by Cu2+, but it was significantly increased by Zn2+. The purified enzyme with a molecular mass of approximately 110 kDa exhibited collagenolytic, gelatinolytic, and caseinolytic activity. The kinetic studies showed that this enzyme had greater hydrolyzing activity toward collagen and gelatin compared with casein. Based on the ratio Vmax/Km, collagen is likely to be the best substrate among three proteins. We found that this collagenase could digest small pieces of bovine skin and tendon into a collagen solution. Interestingly, at pH 6.0-8.0, the soluble collagen could form a collagen membrane, which is useful as a wound-healing biomaterial.","",""

Guided bone regeneration (GBR), commonly used in oral and maxillofacial dental surgery, may show promise for orthopedic applications in repair of cortical bone defects. However, a limitation in the use of GBR for cortical bone defects is the lack of an ideal scaffold that provides sufficient mechanical support to bridge the cortical bone with minimal interference in the repair process. We have developed a new collagen membrane, CelGro™, for use in GBR. We report the material characterization of CelGro and evaluate the performance of CelGro in translational preclinical and clinical studies. The results show CelGro has a bilayer structure of different fiber alignment and is composed almost exclusively of type I collagen. CelGro was found to be completely acellular and free from xenoantigen, α-gal (galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose). In the preclinical study of a rabbit cortical bone defect model, CelGro demonstrated enhanced bone-remodeling activity and cortical bone healing. Microcomputed tomography evaluation showed early bony bridging over the defect area 30 days postoperatively, and nearly complete restoration of mature cortical bone at the bone defect site 60 days postoperatively. Histological analysis 60 days after surgery further confirmed that CelGro enables bridging of the cortical bone defect by induction of newly formed cortical bone. Compared to a commercially available collagen membrane, Bio-Gide®, CelGro showed much better cortical alignment and reduced porosity at the defect interface. As selection of orthopedic patients with cortical bone defects is complex, we conducted a clinical study evaluating the performance of CelGro in guided bone regeneration around dental implants. CelGro was used in GBR procedures in a total of 16 implants placed in 10 participants. Cone-beam computed tomography images show significantly increased bone formation both horizontally and vertically, which provides sufficient support to stabilize implants within 4 months. Together, the findings of our study demonstrate that CelGro is an ideal membrane for GBR not only in oral and maxillofacial reconstructive surgery but also in orthopedic applications (Clinical Trial ID ACTRN12615000027516).","",""

The study comprised an in vitro test and a clinical trial for membrane evaluation. BCP-added collagen membranes with UV cross-linking were prepared. In the in vitro test, scanning electron microscopy, a collagenase assay, and a tensile strength test were performed. The clinical trial involved 14 patients undergoing a ridge preservation procedure. All participants were randomly divided into the test group, which received UV cross-linked membranes (n=7), and the control group, which received chemically cross-linked membranes (n=7). BCP bone substitutes were used for both the test group and the control group. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans were performed and alginate impressions were taken 1 week and 3 months after surgery. The casts were scanned via an optical scanner to measure the volumetric changes. The results were analyzed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. The fastest degradation rate was found in the collagen membranes without the addition of BCP. The highest enzyme resistance and the highest tensile strength were found when the collagen-to-BCP ratio was 1:1. There was no significant difference in dimensional changes in the 3-dimensional modeling or CBCT scans between the test and control groups in the clinical trial (P>0.05). The addition of BCP and UV cross-linking improved the biocompatibility and the mechanical strength of the membranes. Within the limits of the clinical trial, the sites grafted using BCP in combination with UV cross-linked and BCP-added collagen membranes (test group) did not show any statistically significant difference in terms of dimensional change compared with the control group.","",""

Two surgical procedures were performed: arthroscopic cartilage biopsy for isolation and expansion of chondrocytes, which were seeded onto collagen membrane and implanted in the lesion site; the characterization of cultured cells and implant was performed using immunofluorescence for type II collagen (COL2) for cell viability and electron microscopy of the implant. Clinical safety, KOOS and IKDC scores and magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated. We used repeated-measures ANOVA and post-hoc comparisons at α = 5%. COL2 was identified in the cellular cytoplasm, cell viability was higher than 95% and adequate distribution and cell adhesion were found in the membrane. The median follow-up was 10.9 months (7 to 19). We had two cases of arthrofibrosis, one of graft hypertrophy and one of superficial infection as complications, but none compromising clinical improvement.

Mechanical & physiochemical characteristics of the COL/nβ-TCP membrane (1/2 & 1/4) were tested. Proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of seeded cells on bilayer collagen/nβ-TCP thick membrane was examined. Then, critical-sized calvarial defects in 8 white New Zealand rabbits were filled with either Col, Col/nβ-TCP, Col/nβ-TCP combined with L-PRF membrane, or left empty. New bone formation (NBF) was measured histomorphometrically 4 & 8 weeks postoperatively. Compressive modulus increases while porosity decreases with higher β-TCP concentrations. Mechanical properties improve, with 89 % porosity (pore size ∼100 μm) in the bilayer-collagen/nβ-TCP membrane. The bilayer design also enhances the proliferation and ALP activity.

Collagen membranes have been widely used in medicine and dentistry, because of their high biocompatibility and capability of promoting wound healing. Recently, collagen membranes have been applied in guided bone regeneration with comparable outcomes to non-resorbable membranes. Aim of this work is to provide a review on the main features, application, outcomes, and clinical employment of the different types of collagen membranes. Comparisons with non-resorbable membranes are clarified, characteristics of cross-linked collagen versus native collagen, use of different grafting materials and need for membrane fixation are explored in order to gain awareness of the indications and limits and to be able to choose the right membrane required by the clinical condition.","",""

Using a commercial collagen product as control, the biological response of the prepared mats was carefully evaluated with particular attention paid to the influence of the used cross-linking agent (Ca2+, Sr2+, or Ba2+ ions) and to the presence of nanofillers. Fibroblast and keratinocyte cultures successfully proved the safety of the prepared alginate-based mats, whereas ZnO nanoparticles were found to provide strong antibacteriostatic and antibacterial properties; above all, the strontium- and barium-cross-linked samples showed performances in terms of cell adhesion and growth very similar to those of the commercial collagen membrane despite them showing a significantly lower protein adsorption. Moreover, the mechanical and water-related properties of the strontium-cross-linked mats embedding ZnO nanoparticles were proven to be similar to those of human skin (i.e., Young modulus of 470 MPa and water vapor permeability of 3.8 × 10-12 g/m Pa s), thus proving the ability of the prepared mats to be able to endure considerable stress, maintaining at the same time the fundamental ability to remove exudates. Taking into account the obtained results, the proposed alginate-based products could lead to harmless and affordable surgical patches and wound dressing membranes with a simpler and safer production procedure than the commonly employed animal collagen-derived systems.","",""
