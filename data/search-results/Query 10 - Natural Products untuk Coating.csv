This study introduces a novel one-step strategy for applying a polyphenol-aminoglycoside (PA) coating on various implant substrates, including titanium, in a simple and efficient manner. The multifunctional PA coating can reduce implant failure through its strong antibacterial, immunomodulatory, and osteoinductive activities. By eliminating bacterial infection, promoting the M2 macrophage phenotype, and restoring oxidative balance, PA-coated implants create a favorable osteoimmune microenvironment that supports the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, the PA-coated implants exhibit potent osseointegration in vivo. Collectively, these findings indicate that surface modification with a PA coating represents a promising strategy to meet the clinical requirements of next-generation dental and orthopedic implants in complex clinical environments.","",""

This modification significantly enhances cellular adhesion and osteogenic activity.

Regulating the assembly kinetics of SA coatings is critical to controlling the performance of SA coatings, but this area is still in its infancy, especially in the SA coating of peptide-polyphenol. Herein, a library of oligopeptides with rich diversity, numerous polyphenols, and modulators are explored to reveal their roles in the formation and regulation of SA coating. Citric acid (CA) is an effective regulator of interaction between the polyphenols and peptides to produce peptide-polyphenol coatings, TCP. The electrostatic interaction between tannic acid (TA) and cationic peptide drives the formation of TCP, while the multiple hydrogen bonds between CA and TA and peptide dominate the assembly kinetics. With optimized assembly pH and the mass ratio of TA, CA, and peptide, the thickness of TCP coating deposits onto diverse substrates (glass, silica, titanium, polystyrene) is ≈400 nm with controllable kinetics. The multifunctional TCP coatings are endowed via peptide-coupled functional units, including enhanced cellular adhesion, elevated osteogenic capacity, anti-protein adsorption, and antimicrobial. This work contributes to the understanding of the assembly kinetics and functionalization of peptide-polyphenol coatings.","",""

The most important of these effects include cardioprotective, neuroprotective, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, osteoinductive, and anti-microbial effects. Resveratrol has cis and trans isoforms, with the trans isoform being more stable and biologically active. Despite the results of in vitro experiments, resveratrol has limited potential for application in vivo due to its poor water solubility, sensitivity to oxygen, light, and heat, rapid metabolism, and therefore low bioavailability. The possible solution to overcome these limitations could be the synthesis of resveratrol in nanoparticle form. Accordingly, in this study, we have developed a simple, green solvent/non-solvent physicochemical method to synthesize stable, uniform, carrier-free resveratrol nanobelt-like particles (ResNPs) for applications in tissue engineering. UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) was used to identify the trans isoform of ResNPs which remained stable for at least 63 days. The additional qualitative analysis was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), while X-ray diffraction (XRD) determined the monoclinic structure of resveratrol with a significant difference in the intensity of diffraction peaks between commercial and nano-belt form. The morphology of ResNPs was evaluated by optical microscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) that revealed a uniform nanobelt-like structure with an individual thickness of less than 1 μm.

In this study, we prepared biomaterial surfaces coated with antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and metal ions, and evaluated their anti-oxidative and ROS scavenging properties. We revealed that EGCG-coating on polycaprolactone (PCL) film surface increased hydrophilicity and anti-oxidative properties as a function of total phenol content (TPC) potentially due to the increase in phenolic -OH and π-electrons from structural maintenance and directly removed the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by resonance-stabilization. Furthermore, EGCG-coated PCL film increased attachment, spreading area, and viability of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) against H2O2 treatment while stimulated the cellular signaling to reduce apoptotic gene and enhance anti-oxidative enzyme expression. Further, we applied EGCG coating on the surface of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) fibers. Spheroids incorporating EGCG-coated PLLA fibers were able to maintain their shape and showed improved viability and anti-oxidative activities in response to H2O2-induced oxidative stress than control spheroids. Therefore, metal-phenolic network (MPN) coating of EGCG is a suitable method to impart the anti-oxidative properties to biomaterials by evaluating the structural properties and biological effects.","",""

Herein, biomass-derived multilayer-structured absorbable microparticles (MQ x T y ) composed of starches and plant polyphenols are readily constructed for the safe and effective treatment of bone defects with intractable bleeding by coating multiple layers of quaternized starch (Q+) and tannic acid onto microporous starch microparticles via facile layer-by-layer assembly. MQ x T y microparticles exhibit efficient degradability, low cytotoxicity, and good blood compatibility. Among various MQ x T y microparticles with distinct Q+/T- double layers, MQ2T2 with outmost polyphenol layer possess the unique properties of platelet adhesion/activation and red blood cell aggregation, resulting in the best hemostatic performance. In a mouse cancellous-bone-defect model, MQ2T2 exhibits the favorable hemostatic effect, low inflammation/immune responses, high biodegradability, and promoted bone repair. A proof-of-concept study of beagles further confirms the good performance of MQ2T2 in controlling intractable bleeding of bone defects.

TA has tunable interactions with various materials that are widely distributed in the body, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and glycoproteins, through multimodes including hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and charge interactions, assisting TA as important building blocks in the supramolecular self-assembled materials. This review summarizes the recent immense progress in supramolecular self-assembled materials using TA as building blocks to generate different materials such as hydrogels, nanoparticles/microparticles, hollow capsules, and coating films, with enormous potential medical applications including drug delivery, tumor diagnosis and treatment, bone tissue engineering, biofunctional membrane material, and the treatment of certain diseases.

In this study, we developed a titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V, Ti) coated with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and magnesium ions (Mg2+) in a metal-polyphenol network (MPN) formation. Specifically, Ti discs were coated with EGCG in MgCl2 by controlling their concentrations and pH, with the amount of coating increasing with the coating time. An in vitro culture of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) on the EGCG-Mg2+-coated Ti showed significantly enhanced ALP activity and mRNA expression of osteogenic markers. In addition, the EGCG-Mg2+-coated Ti enhanced the mineralization of hADSCs, significantly increasing the calcium content (22.2 ± 5.0 μg) compared with cells grown on Ti (13.5 ± 0.3 μg). Treatment with 2-APB, an inhibitor of Mg2+ signaling, confirmed that the enhancement of osteogenic differentiation in the hADSCs was caused by the synergistic influence of EGCG and Mg2+. The EGCG-Mg2+ coating significantly reduced the osteoclastic maturation of Raw264.7 cells, reducing tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity (5.4 ± 0.4) compared with that of cells grown on Ti (1.0 ± 0.5). When we placed Ti implants onto rabbit tibias, the bone-implant contact (%) was greater on the EGCG-Mg2+-coated Ti implants (8.1 ± 4.3) than on the uncoated implants (4.4 ± 2.0). Therefore, our MPN coating could be a reliable surface modification for orthopedic implants to enable the delivery of an osteoinductive metal ion (Mg2+) with the synergistic benefits of a polyphenol (EGCG).","",""

In the present study, the strong antibacterial and enhanced osteogenic multilayer coating is fabricated using the facile and controllable layer by layer (LBL) technique to integrate GO, Lys, and TA. The thickness of coating exhibited a continuous growth with the deposited process as proved from UV-vis and ellipsometry data, and the physical properties of the coating, such as wettability, roughness, and stiffness are well characterized. The coatings exhibited the synergic effect on the killing bacteria, both Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria represented by E. coli and S. aureus, respectively, and enhancing osteogenesis of dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs), showing the potential application on coatings of dental implants.
