A 2 mm high cap screw was connected to the implant with the aim of not letting a cross-linked collagen membrane to collapse over the implant threads. This membrane covered the implant and the whole defect, filled with a porcine bone graft wet with hyaluronic acid. A second membrane, made of dense polytetrafluoroethylene (dPTFE), was placed over the previous one and left exposed, avoiding a second intervention for its removal, which occurred after a 5-week healing time by grasping the membrane with forceps and removing it with a gentle tug. After cap screw removal, it was possible to insert an healing abutment. The augmented bone remained stable 2.5 years after prosthetic superstructure re-insertion. Soft tissue architecture was maintained since the flaps were not repositioned coronally, the mucogingival line and the fornix were not distorted, and there was no reduction of keratinized mucosa. The benefits of this technique include the reliable defect isolation and containment of graft particles, ease of membrane placement, simplified dPTFE membrane removal, and preservation of mucogingival architecture. The prosthetic superstructure removal provides better access to the surgical site in order to perform the defect debridement and the implant surface decontamination and detoxification, before placing the reconstructive biomaterials. The use of a 2 mm high closure cap or a short healing abutment prevents membrane collapse on the implant threads. Since the dense polytetrafluoroethylene membrane is not buried, but intentionally left exposed, its removal after a 5-6-week healing period doesn't require a second surgery. Furthermore, it is also possible to re-insert the prosthetic superstructure, reducing the overall treatment time generally respected with the conventional submerged approach, which involves uncovering the implant after a healing period of 6-9 months. The authors describe a new technique for the reconstruction of intra-bony vertical defects caused by peri-implantitis, which requires the removal of the prosthetic superstructure to have better access to the surgical site, in order to perform the defect debridement and the implant surface decontamination and detoxification, before placing the reconstructive biomaterials. Two membranes are used: a collagen membrane that covers the whole defect filled with a xenograft, and a dense polytetrafluoroethylene membrane, applied over the collagen one, that is intentionally left exposed in order to easily remove it after a 5-6-week healing period without a second surgery. This cost-effective, predictable treatment protocol is indicated for the general practitioner who usually doesn't treat complex cases requiring advanced skills.","",""

Peri-implant regeneration is a field that requires further optimization to increase predictability. The submerged approach has been shown to yield superior defect fill compared to the non-submerged approach. Nevertheless, primary closure in the submerged approach can result in diminished keratinized tissue. This case study presents an alternative approach to managing advanced peri-implantitis, with the use of open membrane technique. A 71-year-old female presented with #30 peri-implantitis, exhibiting 10 mm probing depth, suppuration upon probing, and severe bone loss. The implant prosthesis was removed prior to the surgery to gain access to instrumentation. Subsequent to the debridement of the defect and implant detoxification, a mix of xenograft and enamel matrix derivatives was used to fill the defect. High-density polytetrafluoroethylene membrane was placed over the defect. The flaps were replaced without attempting primary closure, and the membrane was intentionally left exposed. Disease resolution with significant radiographic bone fill was achieved and remained stable with 20 months follow-up. In addition, keratinized tissue was adequately preserved after surgery. Reconstructive surgery using the open membrane approach can be an alternative for managing advanced peri-implantitis defects, with the advantages of preserving keratinized tissue and reducing intrasurgical trauma. The open membrane technique may serve as a viable alternative to primary closure in guided bone regeneration for peri-implant reconstructive procedures. Advantages include reduced surgical trauma, shorter procedure time, and preservation of keratinized tissue. Careful case selection is essential for achieving predictable outcomes. Factors to consider include defect configuration, the number of remaining bony walls, and the size of the wound opening. In more challenging cases, combination therapy and the adjunctive use of biologics may be considered to enhance regenerative potential and improve clinical results. This case study presents the regenerative treatment of chronic inflammation and bone loss around a dental implant using the open membrane technique. To manage the condition, the crown portion of the dental implant was removed, and the implant surface was thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. The space around the implant was then filled with bone graft and biological agents and covered with a membrane. Unlike typical regenerative procedures, the membrane was intentionally left partially exposed rather than being fully covered by the gum during healing. After the procedure, the infection was resolved, and the area remained healthy for up to 20 months. This case suggests that the open membrane technique may be a successful option for treating severe implant infections, especially when the goal is to preserve protective gum tissue.","",""

Such deficiencies often reveal inadequate bone volume to support implant placement in a position amenable to prosthetic reconstruction. Additionally, an evolving body of literature demonstrates that membrane fixation may lead to improved clinical bone gain through positively influencing blood clot formation, stability, and the eventual osteogenic potential of the defect. Alternative benefits to membrane fixation, such as reduced graft displacement and reduction in wound micromotion, have also been cited as mechanisms for an increased regenerative response. The aim of this report was to present a case, including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for the reconstruction of a horizontal ridge deficiency. The patient's deficiency in ridge volume was found to be a developmental sequelae of lateral incisor agenesis, resulting in an underdeveloped midfacial region of the alveolar process subjacent to sites #7 and #10. The fixation protocol outlined in this report demonstrated adequate horizontal ridge augmentation to facilitate future prosthetic reconstruction with the use of implants. Numerous protocols have been established in an attempt to achieve effective barrier membrane stabilization for bone augmentation procedures. However, some techniques are poorly suited for the anatomically challenging region of the anterior maxilla. A case report describing the utilization of the anterior nasal spine for anchorage of a membrane-stabilizing suture may present a novel, safe, and effective technique for stabilizing the intended region of augmentation, as well as preventing graft migration beyond the membrane-maxilla interface. Key points Regarding guided bone regeneration (GBR) procedures, micromotion of the membrane or of the underlying particulate graft may negatively influence the volume of the augmented site. The ability to adequately stabilize the graft-membrane interface is recognized as a necessary prerequisite to predictably achieve optimal surgical outcomes. To the authors' knowledge, there is no clinical or scientific evidence regarding the use of the anterior nasal spine for membrane anchorage in maxillary GBR procedures, and thus a novel approach to membrane stabilization is introduced.","",""

The recurrent OAF has a detrimental impact on bone regeneration and subsequent implant placement. This case report includes three cases in which sinus graft infection and OAF occurred after maxillary sinus augmentation (MSA). In these cases, treatments to control sinus infection were performed using an otolaryngologist; then, intraoral interventions comprising mucosal flap procedures, bone grafts, and barrier membrane applications were performed 2-5 times by oral surgeons. Nevertheless, OAF recurred persistently. The failure to stop OAF recurrence may be due to the inability to effectively block air pressure at the OAF site. Following a comprehensive debridement of the infected tissue at the previous sinus augmentation site, a pouch was created through sinus mucosal elevation. The perforated sinus mucosa at the OAF site was covered with a non-resorbable membrane in one case and with resorbable collagen membranes in the other two cases, followed by bone grafting within the pouch. Lastly, this procedure was completed by blocking the entrance of the pouch with a cortical bone shell graft and a resorbable collagen membrane. The cortical bone shell graft, obstructing the air pressure from the nasal cavity, facilitated bone formation, and, ultimately, allowed for implant placement. Within the limitations of the present case report, the application of a guided bone regeneration technique involving a cortical bone shell graft and a barrier membrane enabled the closure of the recurrent OAF and subsequent implant placement.","",""

Most of the surgical techniques used in advanced ridge augmentation have the disadvantages of prolonging the patient's edentulous healing and increasing the need for surgical revisits because simultaneous implant placement is not allowed. This report presents a new and simplified method for advanced ridge augmentation, which utilizes a vertical tenting device. The first case presented the reconstruction of the mandibular posterior region with severely resorbed alveolar bone due to peri-implantitis using tenting pole abutment for ridge augmentation. The second and third cases presented three-dimensional ridge augmentations in severely resorbed ridges due to periodontitis. The last case presented horizontal ridge augmentation using a vertical tenting device. All cases were performed under local anesthesia. Implants were simultaneously placed in the bone defect area. A vertical tensioning device was then connected to the implant platform to minimize the collapse of the bone graft during the bone regeneration period due to the contraction of the soft tissue matrix. A sticky bone graft was transplanted onto the exposed surface of the implant and on top of the vertical tensioning device. After covering with an absorbable barrier membrane, the soft tissues were sutured without tension. In all cases, prosthetic restorations were provided to patients after a bone grafting period of 5-6 months, leading to a rapid restoration of masticatory function. Results tracked for up to 6 years revealed observed stable reconstruction of the alveolar bone. The use of a vertical tenting device can prevent the collapse of biomaterials in the augmented ridge during the healing period, leading to predictable outcomes when achieving three-dimensional ridge augmentation.","",""

In Case #1, GBR was performed with a bilayer tunnel flap. The magnesium barrier was placed fixed subperiosteally through remote vertical incisions. In Case #2, GBR was performed using a split-thickness flap design. Volumetric and linear hard tissue alterations were assessed by 3D cone-beam computed tomography subtraction analysis, as well as with conventional intraoral radiography.

This study compares two functionalization methods for enhancing CollaTape® membranes: adsorption of GBMP1α peptide (a BMP-2 biomimetic) and covalent anchoring of its analogue Aoa-GBMP1α. Both functionalizations were performed at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/mL. Optimal conditions were selected basing on osteoblast mineralization assays and resulted to be 0.25 mg/mL for adsorption and 1.5 mg/mL for covalent binding. Peptide surface density analysis revealed values of 0.040 μmol/cm² for adsorption and 0.278 μmol/cm² for covalent anchoring. Biological assays assessed mineralization, proliferation, and gene expression (SPP1, RUNX2) in human osteoblasts, and antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. All functionalized membranes improved osteoblast activity, with adsorption showing superior results. Antibacterial tests showed slight but significant reductions in bacterial colonies, especially for adsorption. Additional mechanical tests via unconfined compression were performed to evaluate the effect of functionalization on the membranes' mechanical properties. These tests confirmed that neither functionalization method compromised the stiffness of the membrane, a critical parameter in clinical applications.

Concerning clinical applications, Mg-based membranes have recently expanded beyond GBR treatment, encompassing many clinical cases. This review underscores the need for continuous innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration to advance the clinical use of Mg-based membranes.

Methods: The mechanical properties of the polymer, together with the fabrication procedure, offer porosity with interconnectivity to permit cell adhesion and proliferation. Bacterial contamination of the BM can induce infection at the bone level, leading to unfavorable clinical outcomes of the regeneration procedure. Results: Therefore, BMs have been proposed as carriers for local GEN antibiotic therapy, demonstrating antibacterial properties against S. aureus, S. mutans, and P. aeruginosa, depending on the drug concentration, while being negligibly affected by the nHAP content.

One grafted defect was covered with a resorbable collagen membrane (Bio-Guide®, Geistlich Pharma AG) (group A), while the other site was covered by a collagen fleece (Jason® collagen fleece, Botiss Biomaterials GmbH, Zossen, Germany) (group B). The rabbits were divided into three study groups (7, 14, and 28 days), each containing six animals. Specimens were taken, and histological and immunohistological analyses were carried out concerning the number of newly formed vessels. Results All specimens showed uneventful bone formation at 28 days. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of blood vessels for the collagen fleece group at all time periods (7, 14, and 28 days). Conclusions The results of this study indicate that covering a bone graft with a quickly resorbable biomaterial (collagen fleece) allows for a greater degree of neoangiogenesis compared to a resorbable collagen barrier membrane.","",""

Mg-NW-Ti was effectively synthesized through a series of chemical reactivity tests, and its morphology, roughness, hydrophilicity, elemental composition, and ion release were characterized. The biological effects of Mg-NW-Ti on MC3T3-E1 cells were assessed and compared with commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) and nanowire-modified titanium (NW-Ti). In addition, a peri-implant bone defect model of rabbit mandibular alveolar bone was constructed to evaluate the effects of Mg-NW-Ti mesh on bone regeneration and osseointegration of the implant. The resultant Ti surface appeared as a nanowire structure under scanning electron microscopy with higher surface roughness and hydrophilicity compared to the CP-Ti. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ion release analysis demonstrated successful loading of magnesium ions onto the titanium surface and effective release into the surroundings. In vitro Mg-NW-Ti exhibited good biocompatibility and significantly enhanced proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1, while the results of the in vivo study demonstrated that the Mg-NW-Ti mesh exhibited a beneficial impact on bone regeneration and implant osseointegration. In conclusion, this novel surface modification of titanium mesh may serve as an effective strategy for optimizing the osteogenic functionality of titanium mesh and harnessing its potential for increased application value.","",""

BCM extracted within 20 or 40 min, which corresponds to a typical implant surgical procedure, and BCM extracted within 24 h, which corresponds to BCM released from the autologous bone chips in situ, contained significant and comparable amounts of TGF-β1, IGF-1, FGF-2, VEGF-A, and IL-11.

Systemic antibiotic treatment often proves inadequate, moreover, the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in oral infections exacerbates this challenge. This study aimed to fabricate antibacterial membranes using a new class of antibiotics for local drug delivery, to eradicate infections and promote tissue regeneration. Membranes loaded with nitazoxanide (NTZ) were fabricated via electrospinning using poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) with varying concentrations of NTZ (0 %, 2.5 %, and 5 % w/w) relative to the polymer weight. Morphochemical of NTZ-loaded membranes were assessed using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Mechanical properties were evaluated using universal testing machine and NTZ release profile from membranes was determined by spectrophotometer (λmax = 444) for 14 days. Antimicrobial efficacy against periodontal pathogens, cell compatibility and mineralization were evaluated using periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). Optimized spinning parameter maintained a uniform fiber diameter and successful loading of NTZ was confirmed by SEM-EDS and FTIR. NTZ incorporation did not significantly affect mechanical properties, whereas the drug release kinetics showed an initial burst, followed by sustained release over 14 days. NTZ-loaded membranes demonstrated antibacterial activity against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn). Importantly, the presence of NTZ showed minimal cell toxicity; however, it reduced the mineralization potential compared with that of the pure PCL membrane, which increased over time. Taken together, these findings established that NTZ-loaded membranes could be promising barrier membrane to counteract microbial environment and aid periodontal bone regeneration.","",""

This technique involves placing a barrier membrane over the bone graft site, and the membrane prevents the invasion of soft tissue (such as gingival tissue) into the bone graft area. This allows the slower-growing bone cells to populate the area without competition, promoting proper bone regeneration. When combined, chitosan and gelatin create composite scaffolds that leverage the strengths of both materials. Chitosan provides structural integrity and antimicrobial properties, and gelatin enhances cell attachment and proliferation, which improves mechanical properties and makes it more suitable for supporting bone regeneration in load-bearing areas. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of chitosan and gelatin-based scaffolds in bone regeneration. Various databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, LILAC, and Google Scholar were screened to adhere to the eligibility criteria. The included studies in the review were the in vivo and in vitro assessment of the chitosan and gelatin efficiency as a scaffold. Six studies were investigated for the involvement of chitosan and gelatin-based scaffolds in bone regeneration. Of these, two in vivo studies examined bone regeneration by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) using different staining techniques, while the remaining four in vitro studies used histologic and histometric analysis where stem cells, chemicals, and other biopolymers were compared. Chitosan and gelatin scaffolds consistently showed better results in terms of bone repair throughout all six experiments. Gelatin's capacity for regeneration can be increased by mixing it with chitosan. For additional advancement, future researchers need to focus on incorporating biopolymers. The potential of scaffolds composed of gelatin and chitosan to replace tissue lost due to periodontitis shows great clinical significance.","",""

We herein report the design of a bioinspired membrane consisting of three functional layers. The primary layer is composed of clay nanosheets and chitin, which form a nacre-inspired laminated structure. A calcium phosphate mineral layer is deposited on the inner surface of the nacre-inspired layer, while a poly(lactic acid) layer is coated on the outer surface. The composite membrane integrates good mechanical strength and deformability because of the nacre-inspired structure, facilitating operations during the implant surgery. The mineral layer induces the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and increases the stiffness of the membrane, which is an important factor for the regeneration process. The poly(lactic acid) layer can prevent unwanted mineralization on the outer surface of the membrane in oral environments. Cell experiments reveal that the membrane exhibits good biocompatibility and anti-infiltration capability toward connective tissue/epithelium cells. Furthermore, in vitro analyses show that the membrane does not degrade too fast, allowing enough time for bone regeneration. In vivo experiments prove that the membrane can effectively induce better bone regeneration and higher trabecular bone density in alveolar bone defects.

These techniques are based on a barrier membrane to direct the growth of new bone and gingival tissue at sites with insufficient volumes or dimensions of bone or gingiva for proper function, esthetics, or prosthetic restoration. Numerous studies have highlighted biocompatibility, space-creation, cell-blocking, bioactivity, and proper handling as essential characteristics of a membrane's performance. Given that bacterial infection is the primary cause of periodontitis, we strongly believe that addressing the antimicrobial properties of these membranes is of utmost importance. Indeed, the absence of effective inhibition of periodontal pathogens has been recognized as a primary factor contributing to the failure of GTR/GBR membranes. Therefore, we suggest considering antimicrobial properties as one of the key factors in the design of GTR/GBR membranes. Antibiotics are potent medications frequently administered systemically to combat microbes and mitigate bacterial infections. Nevertheless, the excessive use of antibiotics has resulted in a surge in bacterial resistance. To overcome this challenge, alternative antibacterial substances have been developed. In this review, we explore the utilization of alternative substances with antimicrobial properties for topical application in membranes. The use of antibacterial nanoparticles, phytochemical compounds, and antimicrobial peptides in this context was investigated. By carefully selecting and integrating antimicrobial agents into GTR/GBR membranes, we can significantly enhance their effectiveness in combating periodontitis. These antibacterial substances not only act as barriers against pathogenic bacteria but also promote the process of periodontal healing.","",""

This study investigated the efficacy of an experimental, slow-degrading, bilayer barrier membrane for application in GBR using in vivo animal models. A synthetic copolymer of poly(lactic acid/caprolactone) (PLCL) was used to prepare a slow-degrading bilayer membrane. The biodegradability of PLCL was evaluated by subcutaneous implantation in a rat model. The barrier function of the PLCL membrane was investigated in a rat calvaria defect model and compared with commercially available membranes composed of type I collagen (Col) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). An alveolar bone defect model in beagle dogs was used to simulate GBR protocols to evaluate the bone regeneration ability of the experimental PLCL membrane. The PLCL membrane showed slow biodegradation, resulting in an efficient and prolonged barrier function compared with commercial materials. In turn, this barrier function enabled the space-making ability of PLCL membrane and facilitated bone regeneration. In the alveolar bone defect model, significantly greater regeneration was achieved by treatment with PLCL membrane compared with Col and PLGA membranes. Additionally, a continuous alveolar ridge contour was observed in PLCL-treated bone defects. In conclusion, the PLCL bilayer membrane is a promising biomaterial for use in GBR given its slow degradation and prolonged barrier function.","",""

Its main purpose is to prevent the migration of soft tissue into the osseous wound space, while allowing osseous cells to migrate to the site. GBR is classified into two main categories: resorbable and non-resorbable membranes. Resorbable membranes do not require a second surgery but tend to have a short resorption period. Conversely, non-resorbable membranes maintain their mechanical strength and prevent collapse. However, they require removal and are susceptible to membrane exposure. GBR is often used with bone substitute graft materials to fill the defect space and protect the bone graft. The membrane can also undergo various modifications, such as surface modification and biological factor loading, to improve barrier functions and bone regeneration. In addition, bone regeneration is largely related to osteoimmunology, a new field that focuses on the interactions between bone and the immune system. Understanding these interactions can help in developing new treatments for bone diseases and injuries. Overall, GBR has the potential to be a powerful tool in promoting bone regeneration.

Barrier membranes can be broadly classified as non-resorbable or resorbable. In contrast to non-resorbable membranes, resorbable barrier membranes do not require a second surgical procedure for membrane removal. Commercially available resorbable barrier membranes are either synthetically manufactured or derived from xenogeneic collagen. Although collagen barrier membranes have become increasingly popular amongst clinicians, largely due to their superior handling qualities compared to other commercially available barrier membranes, there have been no studies to date that have compared commercially available porcine-derived collagen membranes with respect to surface topography, collagen fibril structure, physical barrier property, and immunogenic composition. This study evaluated three commercially available non-crosslinked porcine-derived collagen membranes (Striate+TM, Bio-Gide® and CreosTM Xenoprotect). Scanning electron microscopy revealed similar collagen fibril distribution on both the rough and smooth sides of the membranes as well as the similar diameters of collagen fibrils. However, D-periodicity of the fibrillar collagen is significantly different among the membranes, with Striate+TM membrane having the closest D-periodicity to native collagen I. This suggests that there is less deformation of collagen during manufacturing process. All collagen membranes showed superior barrier property evidenced by blocking 0.2-16.4 μm beads passing through the membranes. To examine the immunogenic agents in these membranes, we examined the membranes for the presence of DNA and alpha-gal by immunohistochemistry. No alpha-gal or DNA was detected in any membranes.

The administration of systemic antibiotics is frequently performed in clinical studies observing regenerative surgical peri-implantitis therapy, but the analysis of the literature does not support a positive effect of this medication. Most studies for regenerative peri-implantitis surgery recommend the removal of the prosthetic rehabilitation and the use a marginal incision with a full-thickness access flap elevation.

An alternative approach referring to the poncho technique may reduce the risk of dehiscence. The effectiveness of implant surface decontamination might have an impact on peri-implant bone regeneration without any clinical superiority of a certain technique.

Wound healing was observed at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively. Cone beam CT was performed immediately and at 6 and 36 months postoperatively. Soft-tissue parameters were measured at 18 and 36 months postoperatively. Implant stability quotient (ISQ) and patient satisfaction were separately evaluated at 6 and 18 months after the operation. The independent sample t test and chi-square test were preformed to analyze quantitative and descriptive statistics, respectively. RESULTS No implants were lost and there were no statistically significant differences in ISQ between the 2 groups. The labial bone plates in the experimental group exhibited a non-significantly greater extent of absorption than did the control group at 6 and 18 months postoperatively. Soft-tissue parameters did not reveal inferior results for the experimental group. Patients in both groups were satisfied.

Treatment options for such defects include bone augmentation with or without implantoplasty. Bone augmentation for the correction of dehiscence or fenestration defects on restored dental implants can be difficult due to the grafted site being close to the margin of the flap, thereby favoring premature bone graft and/or barrier membrane exposure. This article describes the management of an implant fenestration defect using lasso guided bone regeneration, a contemporary technique for bone augmentation and alveolar reconstruction designed to maximize predictability and tissue quality by combining fast-absorbing bone replacement materials with long-lasting barrier membranes and stabilization with internal periosteal sutures.","",""

The aim of the present study was to investigate the tissue responses and the barrier functionality of a novel GBR membrane composed of bovine collagen type I (BM). Therefore, the subcutaneous implantation model in Wistar rats was performed to compare the novel medical device with two already clinically used native porcine-based barrier membranes, i.e., Jason® membrane (JM) and Bio-Gide® (BG), at 10-, 30-, 60-, and 90-days post implantationem.

The bovine membrane exhibited a host tissue reaction that was comparable to both control materials, which was verified by the scoring results and the histomorphometrical macrophage measurements. Moreover, the novel membrane exhibited an integration pattern without material fragmentation up to day 60.

The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the space maintenance capacity and osteogenic performance of the patient-specific PEEK scaffolds for customized alveolar bone augmentation and (2) to compare the biomechanical properties of three-dimensionally printed titanium scaffolds and PEEK scaffolds. Both titanium scaffolds and PEEK scaffolds were designed and manufactured via additive manufacturing technology combined with computer-aided design (CAD). In three-point bending tests, the bending strength of the PEEK scaffold was about 1/3 that of the titanium scaffold. Accordingly, the equivalent strain value of the internal bone graft beneath the PEEK scaffold was about 3 times that beneath the titanium scaffold in finite element analysis, but the maximum deformations of both scaffolds were less than 0.05 mm. Meanwhile, in in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that both scaffolds have similar space maintenance capacity and bone ingrowth efficiency. In conclusion, patient-specific PEEK scaffolds showed significantly lower biomechanical strength but comparable space maintenance and osteogenic properties to the titanium counterpart. Compared with traditional guided bone regeneration (GBR) surgery, both patient-specific PEEK and titanium scaffolds can achieve excellent osteogenic space maintenance ability.

Thus, biodegradable GBR membranes made of pure magnesium might be an alternative. In this study a biodegradable pure magnesium (99.95%) membrane has been proven to have all of the necessary requirements for an optimal regenerative outcome from both a mechanical and biological perspective. After implantation, the magnesium membrane separates the regenerating bone from the overlying, faster proliferating soft tissue. During the initial healing period, the membrane maintained a barrier function and space provision, whilst retaining the positioning of the bone graft material within the defect space. As the magnesium metal corroded, it formed a salty corrosion layer and local gas cavities, both of which extended the functional lifespan of the membrane barrier capabilities. During the resorption of the magnesium metal and magnesium salts, it was observed that the membrane became surrounded and then replaced by new bone. After the membrane had completely resorbed, only healthy tissue remained. The in vivo performance study demonstrated that the magnesium membrane has a comparable healing response and tissue regeneration to that of a resorbable collagen membrane.

Our research indicates that CNTs exhibit high compatibility with bone tissue. The guided bone regeneration (GBR) technique is commonly applied to reconstruct alveolar bone and treat peri-implant bone defects. In GBR, bone defects are covered with a barrier membrane to prevent the entry of nonosteogenic cells such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts. The barrier membrane also maintains a space for new bone formation. However, the mechanical and biological properties of materials previously used in clinical practice sometimes delayed bone regeneration. In this study, we developed a CNT-based membrane for GBR exhibiting high strength to provide a space for bone formation and provide cellular shielding to induce osteogenesis. The CNT membrane was made via the dispersion of single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) in hyaluronic acid solution followed by filtration. The CNT membrane assumed a nanostructure surface due to the bundled SWCNTs and exhibited high strength and hydrophilicity after oxidation. In addition, the membrane promoted the proliferation of osteoblasts but not nonosteogenic cells. CNT membranes were used to cover experimental bone defects made in rat calvaria. At 8 weeks after surgery, more extensive bone formation was observed in membrane-covered defects compared with bone defects not covered with membrane. Almost no diffusion of CNTs was observed around the membrane. These results indicate that the CNT membrane has adequate strength, stability, and surface characteristics for osteoblasts, and its shielding properties promote bone formation. Demonstration of the safety and osteogenic potential of the CNT membranes through further animal studies should facilitate their clinical application in GBR.","",""

Bacterial adhesion was evaluated by the number of colonies formed at 6, 24, and 72 h, and penetration was observed using a scanning electron microscope at 24 and 72 h. Commercially available membranes, composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) or type I collagen, were used as controls. P. gingivalis, S. mutans, and the multispecies bacteria obtained from human saliva adhered onto all the membranes after only 6 h of incubation. However, fewer adherent cells were observed for the PLCL bilayer membrane compared with the controls for all experimental periods. The PLCL membrane was capable of blocking bacterial penetration, and no bacterial cells were observed in the structure. In contrast, bacteria penetrated both the control membranes and were observed at depths of up to 80 µm after 72 h of incubation.

Photoactive atelocollagen (AC) systems functionalised with ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as 4-vinylbenzyl chloride (4VBC), have been shown to generate mechanically competent materials for wound healing, inflammation control and drug delivery, whereby control of the molecular architecture of the AC network is key. Building on this platform, the sequential functionalisation with 4VBC and methacrylic anhydride (MA) was hypothesised to generate UV-cured AC hydrogels with reduced swelling ratio, increased proteolytic stability and barrier functionality for GBR therapy. The sequentially functionalised atelocollagen precursor (SAP) was characterised via TNBS and ninhydrin colourimetric assays, circular dichroism and UV-curing rheometry, which confirmed nearly complete consumption of collagen's primary amino groups, preserved triple helices and fast (< 180 s) gelation kinetics, respectively. Hydrogel's swelling ratio and compression modulus were adjusted depending on the aqueous environment used for UV-curing, whilst the sequential functionalisation of AC successfully generated hydrogels with superior proteolytic stability in vitro compared to both 4VBC-functionalised control and the commercial dental membrane Bio-Gide®.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Collagen-based membranes remain a key component in Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) therapy, but their properties, e.g. proteolytic stability and soft tissue barrier functionality, are still far from optimal. This is largely attributed to the complex molecular configuration of collagen, which makes chemical accessibility and structure-function relations challenging.

Methods: Mg alloy screws that had either undergone a surface treatment with hydrofluoric-acid (HF) or left untreated were investigated. In vitro investigation included XTT, BrdU and LDH in accordance with the DIN ISO 10993-5/-12. In vivo, the screws were implanted into the tibia of rabbits. After 3 and 6 weeks, degradation, local tissue reactions and bony integration were analyzed histopathologically and histomorphometrically. Additionally, SEM/EDX analysis and synchrotron phase-contrast microtomography (µCT) measurements were conducted. The in vitro analyses revealed that the Mg screws are cytocompatible, with improved results when the surface had been passivated with HF. In vivo, the HF-treated Mg screws implanted showed a reduction in gas formation, slower biodegradation and a better bony integration in comparison to the untreated Mg screws. Histopathologically, the HF-passivated screws induced a layer of macrophages as part of its biodegradation process, whereas the untreated screws caused a slight fibrous tissue reaction.

Furthermore, the µCT revealed the presence of a metallic core of the screws, a faster absorbing corrosion front and a slow absorbing region of corroded magnesium. Conclusions: Overall, the HF-passivated Mg fixation screws showed significantly better biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo compared to the untreated screws.","",""

In this procedure, resorbable membranes made of bovine and porcine collagen are increasingly being used, which, in addition to many possible advantages, could have the potential disadvantage of a shorter barrier functionality, especially when augmenting large-volume defects. Thus, it is of importance to evaluate the integration behavior and especially the standing time of barrier membranes using specialized methods to predict its respective biocompatibility. This study is intended to establish a new histomorphometrical analysis method to quantify the integration rate of collagen-based barrier membranes. Three commercially available barrier membranes, i.e., non-crosslinked membranes (BioGide® and Jason® membrane), a ribose-crosslinked membrane (Ossix® Plus), and a newly developed collagen-hyaluronic acid-based (Coll-HA) barrier membrane were implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of 48 6-8-week-old Wistar rats. The explants, after three timepoints (10, 30, and 60 days), were processed and prepared into histological sections for histopathological (host tissue response) and histomorphometrical (cellular invasion) analyses. 10 days after implantation, fragmentation was not evident in any of the study groups. The sections of the Coll-HA, Jason® and BioGide® membranes showed a similar mild inflammatory reaction within the surrounding tissue and an initial superficial cell immigration. Only in the Ossix® Plus group very little inflammation and no cell invasion was detected. While the results of the three commercially available membranes remained intact in the further course of the study, only fragments of the Coll-HA membrane were found 30 and 60 days after implantation. Histomorphometrically, it can be described that although initially (at 10 days post-implantation) similar results were found in all study groups, after 30 days post-implantation the cellular penetration depth of the hyaluronic acid-collagen membrane was significantly increased with time (**** p < 0.0001). Similarly, the percentage of cellular invasion per membrane thickness was also significantly higher in the Coll-HA group at all timepoints, compared to the other membranes (**** p < 0.0001). Altogether, these results show that the histomorphometrical analysis of the cellular migration can act as an indicator of integration and duration of barrier functionality. Via this approach, it was possible to semi-quantify the different levels of cellular penetration of GBR membranes that were only qualitatively analyzed through histopathological approaches before. Additionally, the results of the histopathological and histomorphometrical analyses revealed that hyaluronic acid addition to collagen does not lead to a prolonged standing time, but an increased integration of a collagen-based biomaterial. Therefore, it can only partially be used in the dental field for indications that require fast resorbed membranes and a fast cell or tissue influx such as periodontal regeneration processes.","",""

In the present study, the barrier function and biological and mechanical properties of PRF were investigated both as standard therapy and after thermal processing. Two heating processes were applied: both single-side heating and double-side heating at 90°C for 10 s using a metal plate heater. The appearance and weight of PRF membranes were documented after heating, along with their morphological and mechanical properties evaluated by scanning electron microscope and tensile strength tests. The viability of cells found within PRF membranes was also evaluated using live/dead cell viability and CCK-8 (cell counting kit-8) assays. To comprehensively evaluate the barrier function of PRF membranes, Hoechst staining of human gingival fibroblasts, which can be distinguished from cells within the PRF membrane by emitting blue light at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, was seeded onto the surface of PRF membranes. Furthermore, osteoblasts were cultured with extracts from different PRF groups to evaluate the biocompatibility of PRF membranes. The degradation rate of PRF membranes was examined by digestion assay. Compared with the nonheated PRF control, the size and weight of PRF membranes led to a significant decrease with a denser PRF microstructure following heating. In summary, the double-sided heating of PRF membranes not only demonstrated an improvement in mechanical and degradation properties but also led to a decrease in cell viability and proliferation.","",""

One of the most important characteristics of a resorbable barrier membrane is its mechanical integrity that is required for space maintenance and its tissue integration that plays a crucial role in wound healing and bone augmentation. This study compares a commercially available porcine-derived sugar-crosslinked collagen membrane with two non-crosslinked collagen barrier membranes. The material analysis provides an insight into the influence of manufacturing on the microstructure. In vivo subcutaneous implantation model provides further information on the host tissue reaction of the barrier membranes, as well as their tissue integration patterns that involve cellular infiltration, vascularization, and degradation. The obtained histochemical and immunohistochemical results over three time points (10, 30, and 60 days) showed that the tissue response to the sugar crosslinked collagen membrane involves inflammatory macrophages in a comparable manner to the macrophages observed in the surrounding tissue of the control collagen-based membranes, which were proven as biocompatible. The tissue reactions to the barrier membranes were additionally compared to wounds from a sham operation. Results suggest wound healing properties of all the investigated barrier membranes. However, the sugar-crosslinked membrane lacked in cellular infiltration and transmembraneous vascularization, providing an exclusive barrier function in GBR. Moreover, this membrane maintained a similar swelling ratio over examined timepoints, which suggests a very slow degradation pattern and supports its barrier function. Based on the study results, which showed biocompatibility of the sugar crosslinked membrane and its stability up to 60 days post-implantation, it can be concluded that this membrane may be suitable for application in GBR as a biomaterial with exclusive barrier functionality, similar to non-resorbable options.","",""

A shell and a covering membrane were fabricated by a solvent casting technique based on PCL (70) and BCP (30). The experimental groups were a semi-rigid shell, an airdried membrane, a buffered membrane, and a commercial d-PTFE as a control. Physico-chemical, mechanical properties, and in vitro biocompatibility with osteoblasts and fibroblasts cells were evaluated in all groups. The fabricated materials had rough surfaces with a homogeneous distribution of BCP particles on one side and a smooth surface on the opposite side. The airdried membrane presented a rougher surface on both top and bottom sides (Sq = 605.45 nm, 556.82 nm) than the semi-rigid shell (310.74 nm, 424.56 nm) and the buffered membrane (277.9 nm, 306.98 nm), respectively.

Objectives: This review aims to organize the fundamental characteristics of the barrier membranes that are available and studied for dentistry, based on their components. Results: The principal components of barrier membranes are divided into nonbiodegradable and biodegradable materials. Nonbiodegradable membranes are manufactured from synthetic polymers, metals or composites of these materials. The first reported barrier membrane was made from expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE). Titanium has also been applied for dental regenerative therapy and shows favorable barrier function. Biodegradable membranes are mainly made from natural and synthetic polymers. Collagens are popular materials that are processed for clinical use by cross-linking. Aliphatic polyesters and their copolymers have been relatively recently introduced into GTR and GBR treatments.

The distal roots of 18 premolars of the Beagle' s bilateral maxillary and mandibular were removed, and 18 extraction sockets were obtained. They were randomly divided into 3 groups, and the following procedures were performed on the sockets: (1) filled with Bio-Oss and covered by mSIS (mSIS group), (2) filled with Bio-Oss and covered by Bio-Gide (BG group), (3) natural healing (blank control group). Micro-computed tomograph (Micro-CT) was performed 4 and 12 weeks after surgery to eva-luate the new bone regeneration in the sockets of each group. The postoperative healing was uneventful in all the animals, and no complications were observed through the whole study period. Micro-CT analysis showed that the new bone fraction in the mSIS group and the BG group was significantly higher than that in the blank control group at the end of 4 weeks and 12 weeks (P < 0.05), and more new bone fraction was observed in the mSIS group than in the BG group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The new bone fraction of coronal third part of the socket in the mSIS group and BG group at the end of 4 weeks were significantly higher than that of the middle and apical third part of each group (P < 0.05). The values of bone mineral density were similar at 4 weeks in all the groups (P>0.05), but were significantly higher than that in the control group at the end of 12 weeks (P < 0.05). The bone morphometric analysis showed that the trabecular number and trabecular spacing were significantly better in the mSIS group and the BG group than in the control group at the end of 4 weeks and 12 weeks (P < 0.05), while the value in the mSIS group was slightly higher than in the BG group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The difference in trabecular thickness between all the groups was not statistically significant (P>0.05). mSIS membrane as a barrier membrane combined with deproteinized bovine bone mineral can enhance new bone formation in canine extraction sockets, similar to Bio-Gide collagen membrane.","",""

They act as cell-occlusive devices that should maintain a micromilieu where bone tissue can grow, which in turn provides a stable bed for prosthetic implantation. However, the standing time of collagen membranes has been a challenging area, as native membranes are often prematurely resorbed. Therefore, consolidation techniques, such as chemical cross-linking, have been used to enhance the structural integrity of the membranes, and by consequence, their standing time. However, these techniques have cytotoxic tendencies and can cause exaggerated inflammation and in turn, premature resorption, and material failures. However, tissues from different extraction sites and animals are variably cross-linked. For the present in vivo study, a new collagen membrane based on bovine dermis was extracted and compared to a commercially available porcine-sourced collagen membrane extracted from the pericardium. The membranes were implanted in Wistar rats for up to 60 days. The analyses included well-established histopathological and histomorphometrical methods, including histochemical and immunohistochemical staining procedures, to detect M1- and M2-macrophages as well as blood vessels. Initially, the results showed that both membranes remained intact up to day 30, while the bovine membrane was fragmented at day 60 with granulation tissue infiltrating the implantation beds. In contrast, the porcine membrane remained stable without signs of material-dependent inflammatory processes. Therefore, the bovine membrane showed a special integration pattern as the fragments were found to be overlapping, providing secondary porosity in combination with a transmembraneous vascularization. Altogether, the bovine membrane showed comparable results to the porcine control group in terms of biocompatibility and standing time. Moreover, blood vessels were found within the bovine membranes, which can potentially serve as an additional functionality of barrier membranes that conventional barrier membranes do not provide.","",""

The effects of the membrane (P-C film) on cell cycle, proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization were evaluated using the human osteoblast cell line MG-63, while the barrier ability was examined using MG-63 cells, as well as the human skin fibroblast cell line WS-1. The pore size is one of the factors that plays a key role in tissue regeneration, therefore, we evaluated the pore size of the membrane using a capillary flow porometer. Our results showed that the mean pore size of the P-C film was approximately 7-9 µm, the size known to inhibit cell migration across the membrane. The P-C film also demonstrated excellent cell viability and good biocompatibility, since the cell number increased with time, with MG-63 cells proliferating faster on the P-C film than in the cell culture flask. Furthermore, the P-C film promoted osteoblast differentiation, resulting in higher alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization. Therefore, our results suggest that this P-C film has a great potential to be used in guided bone regeneration during periodontal regeneration and bone tissue engineering.","",""

Macrophages are necessary for alveolar bone regeneration via their polarization and paracrine actions. Our previous studies showed that Cu-bearing Ti6Al4V alloys are capable of regulating macrophage responses. When considering the complexity of oral microenvironments, the influences of Cu-bearing Ti6Al4V alloys on osteoporotic macrophages in infectious microenvironments are worthy of further investigations. In this study, we fabricated Ti6Al4V-Cu alloy by selective laser melting technology and used Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (P.g-LPS) to imitate oral pathogenic bacterial infections. Then, we evaluated the impacts of Ti6Al4V-Cu on osteoporotic macrophages in infectious microenvironments. Our results indicated that Ti6Al4V-Cu not only inhibited the P.g-LPS-induced M1 polarization and pro-inflammatory cytokine production of osteoporotic macrophages but also shifted polarization towards the pro-regenerative M2 phenotype and remarkably promoted anti-inflammatory cytokine release. In addition, Ti6Al4V-Cu effectively promoted the activity of COMMD1 to potentially repress NF-κB-mediated transcription. It is concluded that the Cu-bearing Ti6Al4V alloy results in ameliorated osteoporotic macrophage responses to create a favourable microenvironment under infectious conditions, which holds promise to develop a GBR-barrier membrane for alveolar bone regeneration of osteoporosis patients.","",""

Eight critical-sized defects were surgically created in each sheep and a total of 40 defects were obtained. A deproteinized bovine bone graft was placed in all defects, and the defects were divided into four groups to be covered with L-PRF membrane, PBMT/L-PRF membrane, collagen membrane, or left uncovered as controls.

The PBMT/L-PRF group presented higher values than the L-PRF group and controls for these parameters though not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusions: The findings show that PBMT may provide additional regenerative properties to L-PRF when used as barrier membranes.

Even magnesium (Mg) has been shown to constitute a favorable biomaterial for the development of stabilizing structures. However, it has been described that it is necessary to prevent premature degradation to ensure both the functionality and the biocompatibility of such Mg implants. Different coating strategies have already been developed, but most of them did not provide the desired functionality. The present study analyses a new approach based on ion implantation (II) with PVD coating for the passivation of a newly developed Mg membrane for GBR/GTR procedures. To demonstrate comprehensive biocompatibility and successful passivation of the Mg membranes, untreated Mg (MG) and coated Mg (MG-Co) were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Thereby a collagen membrane with an already shown biocompatibility was used as control material. All investigations were performed according to EN ISO 10993 regulations. The in vitro results showed that both the untreated and PVD-coated membranes were not cytocompatible. However, both membrane types fulfilled the requirements for in vivo biocompatibility. Interestingly, the PVD coating did not have an influence on the gas cavity formation compared to the uncoated membrane, but it induced lower numbers of anti-inflammatory macrophages in comparison to the pure Mg membrane and the collagen membrane. In contrast, the pure Mg membrane provoked an immune response that was fully comparable to the collagen membrane. Altogether, this study shows that pure magnesium membranes represent a promising alternative compared to the nonresorbable volume-stable materials for GBR/GTR therapy.","",""

In situ crystallization of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) on the polydopamine (PDA)-modified membrane significantly raised surface energy, wettability, roughness, and stiffness of the substrate. This modulation led to an almost twofold increment in the primary attachment of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) compare to conventional plastic culture dishes. The findings indicate that polypropylene (PP) membrane modified by PDA/ZIF-8 coating effectively supports the growth and proliferation of DPSCs at a substantial rate. Further analysis also displayed the exaggerated multilineage differentiation of DPSCs with amplified level of autocrine cell fate determination signals, like BSP1, BMP2, PPARG, FABP4, ACAN, and COL2A. Notably, osteogenic markers were dramatically overexpressed (more than 100-folds rather than tissue culture plate) in response to biomechanical characteristics of the ZIF-8 layer. Hence, surface modification of cell culture platforms with MOF nanostructures proposed as a powerful nanomedical approach for selectively guiding stem cells for tissue regeneration.

The concentration of the calcium-form poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) and the glycerol ratio are studied for improving practicability in easy-handling and expanding the coverage area. Gellan gum-based membranes with uniformly distributed calcium aggregates are not only successfully manufactured but also providing excellent characteristics for protein adsorption, bioactivity, and bone cell maturation. Our composite gellan gum-based membranes were tested including to their morphology, mechanical properties, swelling behavior, protein adsorption, drug diffusion, and lysozyme degradation. The biocompatibility, proliferation, and osteoblastic response of membranes were examined by osteoblast-like (MG63) cells. Our results indicate that adequate physical cross-linking with γ-PGA improves the original mechanical properties and delays degradation. Growing glycerol ratio not only enhances the elongation at break and diffusion rate, but it also changes the tensile strength and the remaining weight. In vitro biocompatibility tests, an adequate ratio of γ-PGA modification significantly enhances the proliferation, the secretion of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and mineralization. However, worth noting is the glycerol-modified membrane cannot bear a close resemblance with the non-glycerol group in the high level of osteoblastic response. In general, these tunable materials with biocompatibility, biodegradability, and positive osteoblastic responses were poised to be possible candidates for bone defect repair.","",""

A keyword search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies published in English from January 2015 to January 2020 was conducted for the primary aim and 23 studies were selected. A second search addressing the secondary aim was conducted, and five studies were included. Site-level analysis showed that the weighted mean incidence proportion of minor wound dehiscence and minor infections occurring at the augmented site was 9.9% [95% CI 6.4, 13.9, P < 0.01] and 1.5% [95% CI 0.4, 3.1, P = 0.21) respectively.

Subgroup analysis also revealed that the use of block grafts increased the incidence proportion of minor post-surgical complications, whereas a staged GBR procedure increased the incidence proportion of both minor and major post-surgical complications. Although exposure of the barrier membrane is often associated with less bone regeneration and graft resorption, the type of membrane used (resorbable or non-resorbable) had no statistically significant influence on any post-surgical complication. Histologically, a layer of fibrous connective tissue instead of bone is commonly observed at the interface between the native bone at the recipient site and the regenerated bone in cases with membrane exposure after GBR procedure. Minor wound dehiscence was the highest incidence proportion of post-surgical complications. Methods ranging from daily application of antiseptics, use of systemic antimicrobials, regular reviews, and total removal of the non-integrated biomaterials are commonly prescribed to manage these post-surgical complications in attempt to minimise the loss of tissue at the surgical site.","",""

Additional factors were then assessed, and these included the addition of simvastatin to the membrane, coating the membrane with human MSC, and a combination of those. The addition of simvastatin to the membranes demonstrated a stronger effect at a similar radiological follow-up.

Clinically, periodontal tissue destruction has been managed by an integrated approach involving elimination of injured tissues followed by regenerative strategies with bone substitutes and/or barrier membranes. Regrettably, a barrier membrane with predictable mechanical integrity and multifunctional therapeutic features has yet to be established. Herein, we report a fiber-reinforced hydrogel with unprecedented tunability in terms of mechanical competence and therapeutic features by integration of highly porous poly(ε-caprolactone) fibrous mesh(es) with well-controlled 3D architecture into bioactive amorphous magnesium phosphate-laden gelatin methacryloyl hydrogels. The presence of amorphous magnesium phosphate and PCL mesh in the hydrogel can control the mechanical properties and improve the osteogenic ability, opening a tremendous opportunity in guided bone regeneration (GBR). Results demonstrate that the presence of PCL meshes fabricated via melt electrowriting can delay hydrogel degradation preventing soft tissue invasion and providing the mechanical barrier to allow time for slower migrating progenitor cells to participate in bone regeneration due to their ability to differentiate into bone-forming cells. Altogether, our approach offers a platform technology for the development of the next-generation of GBR membranes with tunable mechanical and therapeutic properties to amplify bone regeneration in compromised sites. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we developed a fiber-reinforced hydrogel platform with unprecedented tunability in terms of mechanical competence and therapeutic features for guided bone regeneration. We successfully integrated highly porous poly(ε-caprolactone) [PCL] mesh(es) into amorphous magnesium phosphate-laden hydrogels. The stiffness of the engineered hydrogel was significantly enhanced, and this reinforcing effect could be modulated by altering the number of PCL meshes and tailoring the AMP concentration. Furthermore, the fiber-reinforced hydrogel showed favorable cellular responses, significantly higher rates of mineralization, upregulation of osteogenic-related genes and bone formation. In sum, these fiber-reinforced membranes in combination with therapeutic agent(s) embedded in the hydrogel offer a robust, highly tunable platform to amplify bone regeneration not only in periodontal defects, but also in other craniomaxillofacial sites.","",""

Notably, heterogeneous double-layer GBR membranes with a compact upper layer and a loose lower layer exhibit enhanced effectiveness in blocking fibroblasts and promoting the growth of osteoblasts. Herein, we present porous and interconnected collagen-based sponges with controllable pore size for the fabrication of absorbable GBR membranes with a heterogeneous double-layer structure. Dialdehyde carboxymethyl cellulose was used to fix collagen-based sponges. The pore size of the sponges can be well controlled by adjusting the cross-linking degree, which is decreased with an increase of cross-linking degree. The sponges show enhanced mechanical properties, inhibited swelling ability and biodegradation, good blood compatibility, and good cytocompatibility. The sponges are feasible to form a heterogeneous double-layer structure with a loose lower layer and a compact upper layer. Interestingly, the lower layer with the pore size of 200-300 μm can promote the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of osteoblasts MC3T3-E1 cells, while the upper layer with the pore size of 20-50 μm makes a great contribution to the growth of myoblast C2C12 cells.

As a ""non-self"" biomaterial, a barrier membrane will inevitably trigger host-membrane immune response after implantation, which entails the activation of phagocytic cells. In the degradation process of a barrier membrane, the cell-mediated degradation may play a more vital role than enzymatic and physicochemical dissolution; however, limited studies have been carried out on this topic. In this context, we investigated the cell-mediated degradation and illustrated the possible key cells and mediators for immunomodulation via in vivo and in vitro studies.
