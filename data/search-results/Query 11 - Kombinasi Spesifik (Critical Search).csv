In clinical treatment, significant bone defects are often caused by trauma, developmental deformity, tumour resection and infection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of green synthesis of TiO2 from propolis extract/collagen/HA (Hydroxyapatite) scaffolds on bone regeneration in rats. Water uptake, biodegradability, porosity and biodegradation of the scaffolds were evaluated after they were synthesised using freeze-dry method. Cell viability by MTT assay was then evaluated. During the 4, 8 and 12 weeks following the scaffold implantation, the bone regeneration was evaluated using macroscopic and microscopic tests to determine the effectiveness of green synthesis of TiO2 from propolis extract/collagen/HA scaffolds. Compared to the HA/Coll scaffold, ProTiO2 /HA/Coll scaffold was reduced porosity, water absorption and degradability porosity. Based on in vitro tests, both synthetic scaffolds induced cell growth and were less toxic and stimulated cell growth. Based on histopathological testing, the ProTiO2 /HA/Coll scaffolds formed high levels of bone during 12 weeks in comparison with HA/Coll and control group. ProTiO2 /HA/Coll composite can be used in regenerative medicine, bone fillers and scaffolds. As a result, this research suggests that ProTiO2 /HA/Coll composites could be promising candidates for bone regeneration.","",""

The goal of bone regeneration by tissue engineering approaches is to fabricate bone implants in order to restore bone structure and functions. The use of stem cells and polymer scaffolds provides the conditions for tissue regeneration based on tissue engineering. This study aimed to fabricate a combined matrix of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and propolis extract, which is a mixture of pollen and beeswax collected by bees from certain plants and has long been used in traditional herbal medicine, to promote the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose- derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs). The scaffold was fabricated through electrospinning and was immersed in a propolis extract solution. Then, AD-MSCs were cultured and differentiated into the osteogenic lineage. The cell viability on the scaffold was evaluated by MTT assay. Osteogenic differentiation of the seeded stem cells was detected by evaluating calcium content, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and the expression of bonespecific genes. The viability of cells was not affected by propolis-coated and uncoated fabricated scaffolds, while higher calcium content, ALP activity, and expression of RUNX-2, type I collagen, osteocalcin, and osteonectin were observed in cells differentiated on propolis-coated PLGA scaffold on days 7, 14, and 21 of differentiation compared to PLGA scaffold. The results of this study showed that the presence of propolis in the scaffold could lead to better cell attachment and strengthen the osteoinduction process in stem cells.","",""

The scaffold was characterized by means of in vitro enzymatic degradation; in vitro HPW release; and in vivo wound-healing mouse model, wound-healing-specific RNA, transcripts, and protein markers. The functional activity of the HPW extracted from raw propolis was determined using total flavonoids, antioxidant scavenging assays, and anti-hemolytic principles. The results indicated that HPW had a high flavonoid content (20 μg/mL of wax) and antioxidant activities. The effective concentration (EC50) of HPW was estimated (28 mg/mL) and was then used in the subsequent in vivo experiments. Additionally, the dopped mixture of CHDs and HPW substantially enhanced the wound-healing process and regulated wound biochemical markers such as hexoseamine and melondialdehyde. CHDs- HPW upregulated the expression of growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (2.3-fold), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (1.7-fold), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) (3.1-fold), indicating their potential capacity to perform wound re-epithelialization and the loading of ground tissue. Pro-inflammatory markers IL-1 β (51 pg/mL) and TNF-α (220 pg/mL) were significantly reduced in the CHD-HPW-treated wound. These interesting results were further confirmed using mRNA and protein growth factors from the wound, which enhanced the load of collagen-I in the wound site. In conclusion, CHDs-HPW exhibited a significant reduction in inflammation and inflammatory markers and helped to obtain a faster wound-healing process in a mouse model. The newly engineered biosponge could be developed as a promising therapeutic approach for the regeneration and repair of damaged human skin in the future.","",""

In this study, we produced scaffolds of type I collagen, extracted from Wistar Hanover rat tail tendons, and impregnated them with propolis nanoparticles (NPs) for applications in regenerative medicine. Our results show that the impregnation of propolis NPs to collagen scaffolds affected the collagen denaturation temperature and tensile strength. The changes in structural collagen self-assembly due to contact with organic nanoparticles were shown for the first time. The fibril collagen secondary structure was preserved, and the D-pattern gap increased to 135 ± 28 nm, without losing the microfiber structure. We also show that the properties of the collagen scaffolds depended on the concentration of propolis NPs. A concentration of 100 μg/mL of propolis NPs with 1 mg of collagen, with a hydrodynamic diameter of 173 nm, was found to be an optimal concentration to enhance 3T3 fibroblast cell metabolic activity and cell proliferation. The expected outcome from this research is both scientifically and socially relevant since the home scaffold using natural nanoparticles can be produced using a simple method and could be widely used for local medical care in developing communities.","",""

The PU/EEP membrane was used as the top layer to protect the wound area from external contamination and dehydration, while the PCL/Gel scaffold was used as the sublayer to facilitate cells' adhesion and proliferation. The bilayer wound dressing was investigated regarding its microstructure, mechanical properties, surface wettability, anti-bacterial activity, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and its efficacy in the animal wound model and histopathological analyzes. Scanning electron micrographs exhibited uniform morphology and bead-free structure of the PCL/Gel scaffold with average fibers' diameter of 237.3 ± 65.1 nm. Significant anti-bacterial activity was observed against Staphylococcal aureus (5.4 ± 0.3 mm), Escherichia coli (1.9 ± 0.4 mm) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1.0 ± 0.2 mm) according to inhibition zone test.
