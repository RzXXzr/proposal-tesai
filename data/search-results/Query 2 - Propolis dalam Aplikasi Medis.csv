An antibacterial suture material with enhanced wound healing function may protect the surgical site from infections. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the synergistic effect of propolis and biogenic metallic nanoparticles when combined with silk sutures for biomedical use. Silver nanoparticle (AgNP) synthesis was carried out via a microbial-mediated biological route and impregnated on propolis-loaded silk sutures using an in situ process. Silk sutures fabricated with propolis and biosynthesized AgNPs (bioAgNP-propolis-coated sutures) were intensively characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The antibacterial characteristics of the bioAgNP-propolis-coated sutures were evaluated using the agar plate method. The biocompatibility of the bioAgNP-propolis- coated sutures was evaluated using 3T3 fibroblast cells, and their wound-healing potential was also investigated. BioAgNP-propolis-coated sutures displayed potent antibacterial activity against pathogenic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. BioAgNP-propolis-coated silk sutures were found to be biocompatible with 3T3 fibroblast cell culture. In vitro wound healing scratch assay also demonstrated that the extract of bioAgNP-propolis-coated sutures stimulated the 3T3 fibroblasts’ cell proliferation. Coating the silk sutures with propolis and biogenic AgNPs gave an effective antibacterial capacity to surgical sutures besides providing biocompatibility and wound healing activity.","",""

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the formulations and controls were tested against five oral bacterial species. Both the effect on a multispecies dental biofilm precultured for 3.5 days as well as the inhibition of de-novo biofilm formation up to 24 h were investigated. Test substances at concentrations of 20%, 10% and 5% were applied to preformed biofilm for 1 min. The reduction in colony-forming units (cfu), metabolic activity, and biofilm mass were determined. Similarly, the test substances were applied to surfaces for 30 min before bacteria and media were added. The reduction of a tetrazolium dye (MTT assay) was used to assess cytotoxicity on gingival fibroblasts. The MIC values of all toothpaste formulations including TP con were very low with the highest MIC of 0.04%. In precultured biofilms, both the number of colony forming units (cfu) and metabolic activity decreased following addition of any toothpaste. The greatest reductions of cfu were found after addition of 20% TP com (by about 6 log10) and after 20% Manuka prop (by about 2.3 log10). However, the biofilm mass was not reduced. Coating the surface with toothpaste formulation, the cfu in the newly formed biofilm decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, with TP com being most active. Both 20% of Manuka prop and Manuka F reduced the cfu counts more than the TP con at 24 h. The toothpaste formulations affected the viability of gingival fibroblasts in a concentration-dependent manner, with no differences observed among the formulations. The Manuka-honey containing toothpastes might be an alternative to toothpaste containing conventional chemical agents. Further research is needed to clinically examine the effect on caries and gingivitis prevention.","",""

This study assessed the impact of sandblasting, sandblasting plus acid etching, Er,Cr:YSGG laser, and propolis implant surface treatments and occlusal load on the osseointegration of titanium dental implants in dogs. Seventy-two titanium dental implants with a diameter of 4 mm and a length of 10 mm were divided into four groups according to implant surface modifications (n=18 for each group): group A: sandblasting plus acid etching, group B: sandblasting with Al2 O3, group C: Er,Cr:YSGG laser, group D: propolis coating. Twenty-four local breed male dogs were used. Premolar teeth (P1, P2, and P3) were extracted on the left side of the mandible, and after 12 weeks of bone healing, implants were unilaterally installed. The osseointegration at three study times from implant installation (14, 90, and 180 days) was evaluated. The dog jaws were scanned using an intraoral scanner for the virtual design of screw-retained three-unit crowns after 90 days of osseointegration. Final radiographs were taken before the animals were sacrificed at 14, 90, and 180 days, and the histological analysis was performed. Radiographic analysis showed new bone formation (NBF) along and in contact with the implant surface of the treated groups. The histological analysis after 14 days in groups A and B revealed a uniform and ongoing pattern of bone growth and many osteoblasts with few osteocytes within lacunae in new bone trabeculae. Group C showed an increase in the number of osteoblasts lining thin bone trabeculae. Group D showed a generative power concerning bone. At 90 days, there was increased bone ingrowth, and the new bone matured in all the treated implant groups. At 180 days, dense mature bone apposition was in direct contact with delayed-loaded implant surfaces. A radiographic examination revealed that surface modification significantly impacted osseointegration, with a strong bond between the implant surface and the surrounding bone. The histological sections at the 14-day interval revealed obvious bone remodeling activity, especially in sandblasting plus acid etching and sandblasting-modified implant surface groups. At the 90-day interval, bone ingrowth had increased, and the new bone became mature, especially in sandblasting and propolis surface modification groups. After 180 days of the delayed-loaded implant osseointegration, differences were observed between different implant-treated groups with a remarkable remodeling of the bone, especially in the propolis coating group.","",""

Sixteen male dogs of local breed,1-1.5 years of age, weighing 22 ± 3 kg, were divided into two main groups (n-8 dogs each): a non-stressed group (group I) and stressed group (group II). Each of these groups is further divided into four implant groups per surface treatment, A, B, C, and D (two dogs per implant group), each dog has three implants. The ISQ was tested at 0 (baseline), 14, and 90 days with a noninvasive EasyCheck® device. Serum cortisol in the stressed and non-stressed groups was analyzed at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 days with a canine cortisol ELISA kit. The data were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc test at a 0.05 level of significance. For implant stability quotient (ISQ), sandblasting in the non-stressed (group I) had the highest mean value (88.0) at 90-days, whereas sandblasting with acid etching at 14-days had the lowest mean value (82.6). Sandblasting in the stressed (group II) had the highest mean value (88.3) at 90-days, whereas the laser surface treatment had the lowest mean value (72.00) at 14-days.

In market, they are produced as T-shaped polyethylene (or propylene) and metal (especially copper) composites. Although the metal component is utilized to provide antibacterial efficacy, prolonged implantation and the presence of a wide range of bacteria flora in the intrauterine environment make IUDs susceptible to bacterial contamination, biofilm formation, and unpleasant infection. In the presented study, the propolis, a natural anti-bacterial/-viral product used for different biomedical applications, coating strategy was applied comparatively in three different ways: coating directly on metal components, coating on polymeric material, and using carrying polymer. In addition, antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, E. coli) bacterial strains were investigated by both dynamic bacterial culture (bacterial inhibition activity) and biofilm (biofilm formation resistance) tests. As a result of 48 h of dynamic bacterial culture; it was determined that the antibacterial inhibition efficiency depending on propolis concentration increased up to 99.5% and 98.5% for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. In addition, the carrying polymer allows IUDs to cover surfaces more homogeneously, as well as improve antibacterial activity. Similarly; it was determined that biofilm formation resistance was improved by 44.33% for E. coli and by 45.99% for S. aureus with both the propolis concentration and the use of carrying polymer. As a result, it has been revealed that propolis will be classified as an alternative, promising, and effective coating agent for improving antibacterial properties and biofilm formation resistance of IUDs.","",""
