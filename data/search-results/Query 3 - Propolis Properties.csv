Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the synergistic effect of propolis and biogenic metallic nanoparticles when combined with silk sutures for biomedical use. Silver nanoparticle (AgNP) synthesis was carried out via a microbial-mediated biological route and impregnated on propolis-loaded silk sutures using an in situ process. Silk sutures fabricated with propolis and biosynthesized AgNPs (bioAgNP-propolis-coated sutures) were intensively characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The antibacterial characteristics of the bioAgNP-propolis-coated sutures were evaluated using the agar plate method. The biocompatibility of the bioAgNP-propolis- coated sutures was evaluated using 3T3 fibroblast cells, and their wound-healing potential was also investigated. BioAgNP-propolis-coated sutures displayed potent antibacterial activity against pathogenic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. BioAgNP-propolis-coated silk sutures were found to be biocompatible with 3T3 fibroblast cell culture. In vitro wound healing scratch assay also demonstrated that the extract of bioAgNP-propolis-coated sutures stimulated the 3T3 fibroblasts’ cell proliferation. Coating the silk sutures with propolis and biogenic AgNPs gave an effective antibacterial capacity to surgical sutures besides providing biocompatibility and wound healing activity.","",""

Similarly, nanomaterials, particularly those based on zinc oxide, hold great potential for biomedical applications due to their unique properties. This study evaluates the antimicrobial efficacy of a formulation combining propolis, pollen, and ZnO nanorods (PrPoZnO). SEM and FTIR analysis confirmed ZnO nanorod integration within the propolis-pollen matrix. Antimicrobial testing revealed significant inhibitory effects on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with viability reduction of up to 85% and biofilm inhibition of 50% and 40%, respectively. The PrPoZnO mixture also reduced Candida albicans growth by 90%, inhibited biofilm formation by 60%, and suppressed the yeast-to-hyphae transition, a key virulence factor. Furthermore, the biocompatibility testing of the PrPoZnO mixture in several cell lines demonstrated no cytotoxic effects at the higher concentration, suggesting its potential for safe biomedical applications. In terms of mechanism, PrPoZnO modulated oxidative stress responses, decreasing ROS levels in bacteria while inducing ROS production in C. albicans, suggesting that ZnO nanorods are the key player to induce mechanical damage of microbes. These findings underscore the potential of PrPoZnO as an innovative and biocompatible compound, supporting its suitability for further clinical investigation.","",""

This study aimed to develop macroporous bone scaffolds composed of a chitosan/agarose matrix reinforced with nanohydroxyapatite and enriched with stable CAPE derivatives to enhance their biomedical potential for applications in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. A comprehensive evaluation of microstructural and biological properties of the produced scaffolds was conducted. The fabricated scaffolds exhibited high porosity (49-60%) with interconnected pores and compressive strength (1.2-1.8 MPa), closely resembling cancellous bone and indicating suitability for bone regeneration. They were biocompatible, promoted osteoblast adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, and supported apatite deposition on their surfaces, demonstrating strong bioactivity and potential for implant osseointegration. Importantly, the scaffolds did not trigger excessive production of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, suggesting a low risk of inflammatory responses. Additionally, CAPE-enriched scaffolds inhibited biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, reducing the risk of implant-associated infections. In summary, these CAPE-modified scaffolds integrate optimal microstructural and biological features, such as reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting biofilm formation, and thus offer a promising strategy for enhancing bone repair and regeneration in clinical applications.","",""

To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of ethanolic extracts of propolis from Tame (Arauca) on biofilms formed in co-cultures from reference strains and co-cultures with clinical isolates of oral pathogens. Propolis was collected from Apis mellifera hives placed in rural Tame (Arauca), located in the foothills of the Eastern Andes (Colombia). Ethanolic extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared in a 0.07 g/mL concentration and biological characterization was performed on single and complex co-cultures of S. mutans (serotype c), S. sanguinis, and C. albicans using disc diffusion test, determination of MIC and BMC, growth curves and biofilm formation. The cell viability and metabolic activity of primary cell cultures derived from a dental pulp explant were evaluated using the MTT assay. EEP exhibited higher inhibition zones than chlorhexidine against S. mutans and C. albicans and lower efficacy against S. sanguinis. Among the microorganisms evaluated, S. mutans showed the lowest MIC and BCM values, followed by C. albicans and S. sanguinis. Growth curves and biofilm formation assays revealed higher inhibition in co-cultures of reference strains (S. mutans + C. albicans), while multi-species cultures (S. mutans + S. sanguinis + C. albicans), or clinical strains (S. mutans clinical isolated + S. sanguinis + C. albicans), showed higher resistance. Cell viability assays revealed low cytotoxicity (<30%) in primary cell cultures. EEPs exhibited antimicrobial activity against relevant oral pathogens, especially in simple co-cultures, supporting their potential as natural therapeutic alternatives. However, their efficacy decreases in the presence of clinical strains and complex co-cultures, highlighting the importance of considering these variables in the development of oral treatments.","",""

This systematic review evaluates the effects of propolis-modified GIC on antimicrobial activity and physico-mechanical properties, while identifying optimal formulations and concentrations for clinical use. Special emphasis is placed on methodological heterogeneity, chemical characterization gaps, and future research needs. Publications up to the end of 2024 were included from the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus. The review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024627498) and conducted according to PRISMA guidelines using the PICO framework. Propolis-modified GIC generally demonstrated enhanced antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus, and Candida albicans, particularly at concentrations of 25-50%. Mechanical outcomes varied with concentration, with 25% often balancing antimicrobial efficacy and mechanical stability, while higher concentrations improved hardness but sometimes reduced compressive and bond strength. Considerable heterogeneity was observed in GIC brands, propolis sources, extraction techniques, and incorporation methods, limiting direct comparability. Most studies lacked detailed chemical characterization, making it unclear which flavonoids or phenolic compounds drive the observed effects. Yellow discoloration was the main reported esthetic change, with no studies assessing long-term color stability or translucency. Propolis-modified GIC is a promising bioactive restorative material with potential antimicrobial benefits. However, methodological weaknesses, heterogeneity in preparation, and absence of chemical and long-term esthetic evaluation limit the direct clinical applicability of current evidence. Standardized protocols for material preparation, bioactive component identification, and comprehensive testing of mechanical and esthetic properties are recommended to advance this field.","",""

In this study, the protective effects of PCB against the migration and proliferation of VSMCs were investigated. MTT and BrdU assays were performed to estimate the cytotoxicity and cell proliferative activity of PCB, respectively. Rat aortic VSMC migrations and neointima formation were evaluated using wound healing, boyden chamber assays, and in balloon-injured (BI) rat, respectively. PCB suppressed the phosphorylated levels of p38 in PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs followed by reducing the expression of MMP2 and 9. PCB downregulated the expression levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as PCNA, CDK2, CDK4, and Cyclin D1. Furthermore, the phosphorylated levels of FAK at Y397 and Y925 sites and the expression levels of FAK-related proteins such as Integrin β1, Paxillin, Talin, and Vinculin were significantly reduced by PCB in PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs. The neointima formation was markedly decreased by PCB administration in the carotid artery of a balloon-injured rat. In conclusion, PCB inhibits the proliferation and migration of VSMCs by stimulation of PDGF-BB through the regulation of the p38 and FAK signaling pathway. Therefore, PCB may be a promising therapeutic candidate for preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and restenosis.","",""

Brazilian red propolis (BRP) has shown broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, yet its efficacy against mycobacteria is poorly characterized. This study evaluated the in vitro antimycobacterial potential of a crude hydroalcoholic extract of BRP (CHEBRP). Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined against drug-susceptible and rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis strains (M. tuberculosis H37Rv-ATCC 27294, clinical isolate, and rifampicin-resistant clinical isolate; M. kansasii ATCC 12478 and clinical isolate; M. avium ATCC 25291 and clinical isolate). Fractional inhibitory concentration indices were calculated to assess interactions with isoniazid and rifampicin. Biofilm inhibition was measured, and cytotoxicity was assessed in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Intracellular activity was quantified using infected macrophage cultures. CHEBRP exhibited potent activity against most M. tuberculosis strains tested, including rifampicin-resistant strains. Its combination with isoniazid or rifampicin yielded an indifferent interaction, supporting the feasibility of co-administration. CHEBRP significantly inhibited biofilm formation, showed minimal cytotoxicity toward macrophages, and achieved substantial clearance of intracellular bacilli. These in vitro findings highlight CHEBRP as a promising candidate for adjunctive antimycobacterial therapy. Further studies should investigate its in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and activity against a broader range of mycobacterial species.","",""

A cellulose-producing bacterial strain, Limosilactobacillus fermentum 6BC (accession number OM978241.1), was isolated from spoiled grapes and identified through 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The structural and chemical characteristics of the synthesized BC were analyzed using Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). To enhance the biological functionality of BC, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were incorporated via a sono-coprecipitation method to produce ZnO-decorated BC (BCZO). The resulting BCZO was subsequently integrated into a hydroxypropyl ethyl cellulose (HPEC) matrix, forming a bionanoplatform designed for the immobilization of bioactive agents, specifically curcumin (Cc) and propolis extract (Pp). TEM was used to examine the nanoscale distribution of ZnO, while FTIR, XRD, SEM, and EDS were employed to characterize the composite structure and confirm drug incorporation. The fabricated scaffolds were further subjected to comprehensive antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytocompatibility, and in vitro wound healing assessments to evaluate their biological performance. The antimicrobial assays demonstrated effective inhibition of L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, E. coli, Salmonella sp., and the fungus C. albicans. The bionanoplatforms also exhibited concentration-dependent antioxidant activity in DPPH and ABTS assays (ascorbic acid as control). The cytocompatibility tests on human skin fibroblasts (HFB-4) showed excellent cell viability across all formulations.

Correspondingly, in 4-species biofilms, selective agar plating and FISH-staining showed decreased abundance of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis after 4 h recovery following SL treatment vs. PBS control while maintaining a robust commensal biofilm of S. oralis and V. parvula. In contrast, CHX or LIS treatment demonstrated non-selective killing, leading to sparse biofilms with residual F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. When tested against clinical ex vivo multispecies biofilms, all oral rinses showed significant antibiofilm effects (all p < 0.001), disrupting biofilm structure and reducing bacterial viability. Lastly, 3D human fibroblast spheroids treated with CHX or LIS displayed greater cytotoxicity with detachment of cellular debris from the spheroid mass, while spheroids exposed to SL exhibited minimal cell death with cellular viability maintained across the spheroid structure.

Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola release lipopolysaccharide (LPS), constituting a virulence factor that takes part in the brain inflammatory process. Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1) are a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines released during periodontal diseases. Propolis is a rich source of quercetin and apigenin, which exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities, influencing the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Considering this aspect, models with stimulated HGF-1, followed by LPS and/or interferon-α (IFN-α), were used. Aim: This study was designed to evaluate the concentrations of selected cytokines produced by HGF-1, which may influence brain inflammation. The immunomodulatory effects of apigenin and quercetin were investigated by measuring the concentration of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-15 (IL-15), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α). This study's novelty is based on insights into the immunomodulatory effects of selected flavonoids by correlating the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by gingival fibroblasts during periodontal disease with inflammatory processes in the brain. The cytotoxicity of apigenin and quercetin was estimated using the MTT assay. Fibroblasts were stimulated with LPS at 200 ng/mL and/or IFN-α at 100 U/mL concentration, followed by incubation with apigenin (25-50 µg/mL) and quercetin (25-50 µg/mL). Cytokine concentrations were measured using the xMAP technology. Results: The most pronounced and statistically significant reduction in cytokine levels, particularly IL-6 and IL-15, was observed for quercetin in both concentrations (25 µg/mL and 50 µg/mL), especially following LPS stimulation. Apigenin in both analysed concentrations also significantly decreased the level of IL-6. These results suggest that quercetin and apigenin may indirectly act as potential immunomodulators in preventing brain inflammation by inhibiting the inflammatory process in periodontitis; however, this should be confirmed in further studies.","",""

It induces apoptosis in various cancer cells, making it a highly promising natural medicine. Although the health benefits and food applications of TGP are widely recognised, no study has explored its effects on Taiwan oral cancer cells (OECM1). This study investigated whether TGP induces apoptosis in OECM1 cells. Methods: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin-layer chromatography, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry were used to identify the components in TGP and the fruit peel of Macaranga tanarius. The inhibitory activities of TGP dissolved in DMSO (TGPDMSO) and encapsulated in food-grade zein nanoparticles (TGPNP) against OECM1 cells were compared using MTT assays. The morphological changes, cell cycle analysis, and protein expression profiles of OECM1 cells after the TGP treatments were performed using microscopy, flow cytometry, and Western blot, respectively. Results: An MTT assay of TGPDMSO-treated OECM1 cells suggested an IC50 of 12.6 µg/mL, demonstrating that TGPDMSO exhibits significant cytotoxicity. Subsequent MTT assays revealed TGPNP's cytotoxicity against OECM1 with an IC50 of 11.6 µg/mL. Flow cytometry revealed that TGPNP induced a cell arrest in S phase and DNA fragmentation. Western blotting analyses manifested an increase in Bax and cl-Casp9 and a decrease in Bcl2 and PARP. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that both TGPDMSO and TGPNP treatments induced apoptosis in OECM1 cells with a comparable IC50. Notably, utilising edible zein as a nanoparticle carrier for TGP mitigates the cytotoxicity risk associated with DMSO, providing a novel and safe approach for cancer treatment.","",""

The reduction of a tetrazolium dye (MTT assay) was used to assess cytotoxicity on gingival fibroblasts. The MIC values of all toothpaste formulations including TP con were very low with the highest MIC of 0.04%. In precultured biofilms, both the number of colony forming units (cfu) and metabolic activity decreased following addition of any toothpaste. The greatest reductions of cfu were found after addition of 20% TP com (by about 6 log10) and after 20% Manuka prop (by about 2.3 log10). However, the biofilm mass was not reduced.

Gliomas have the lowest survival rate among all tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by high aggressiveness and poor response to treatment. The tumor microenvironment is a source of cytokines such as IL-6, IFN-γ, VEGF, and PDGF-BB, secreted mainly by tumor and immune cells. These cytokines play a significant role in angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis formation. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Brazilian green propolis, derived from Baccharis dracunculifolia DC and rich in artepillin C, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, chemopreventive, and anticancer activities. Additionally, it can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, demonstrating neuroprotective effects.

Results: The absence of cytotoxic effects of EEP-B and artepillin C on human astrocytes of the CCF-STTG1 lineage was demonstrated. Stimulation with LPS, IFN-α, and their combination (LPS + IFN-α) significantly increased the secretion of the tested cytokines compared to the control cell line. The most pronounced and statistically significant reduction in cytokine levels, particularly IL-6 and VEGF, was observed following EEP-B treatment at both tested concentrations under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions.

Biological activity was evaluated by in vitro cell viability performed on NIH/3T3 fibroblasts incubated with 10, 100, and 1000 μg/mL of propolis nanoparticles for 48 hours.

In contrast, the results of the viability of metastatic murine B16F10 cells indicate that a dose with a concentration of 5 μg/mL in the cell culture media is sufficient to stop the abnormal cell growth, having an antitumor effect. This effect might be related to the flavonoids present in the propolis nanoparticles.

According to the results obtained from this study, reducing the size of raw propolis down to nanoparticles and dispersing them in water solvents enhance its positive effects.

PROP analysis revealed flavonoids such as quercetin, kaempferol, pinocembrin and galangin, as well as phenolic acids such as caffeic and cinnamic acids, known for their bioactive properties. RJ contained mainly proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and sugars, reflecting its role as a nutritionally and biologically active substance. According to the results of this first study evaluating the effect of PROP and RJ on E. intestinalis, all concentrations evaluated in the study showed a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of E. intestinalis spores compared to the control group. In conclusion, we believe that PROP and RJ should be considered as an alternative option in the development of antimicrosporidial drugs due to their potential medicinal and pharmaceutical properties.","",""

This study aimed to characterise and identify the antimicrobial compounds (AMCs) synthesised by BvPD9 through integration of genome mining and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. The whole-genome sequence of BvPD9 contained 4,263,351 base pairs and 4101 protein-coding sequences, with 12 potential AMC biosynthetic gene clusters. Comparative genomic analysis highlighted the unique profile of BvPD9 that possesses the largest number of unknown proteins, indicating significant potential for further exploration. The combined genomics-metabolic profiling uncovered five AMCs in BvPD9 extract, including bacillibactin, bacilysin, surfactin A, fengycin A, and bacillomycin D. The extract exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum against 25 pathogenic bacteria, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, 0.032 mg/ml) against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, and the lowest minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC; 0.128 mg/ml) against MRSA ATCC 700699 and Aeromonas hydrophilia. The robust stability of BvPD9 extract was demonstrated at high temperatures, over a wide range of pH conditions (6 to 12) and in the presence of various hydrolytic enzymes. Additionally, the extract showed 50% haemolytic and cytotoxicity activity at 0.158 and 0.250 mg/ml, respectively. These characteristics suggest potential applications of BvPD9 metabolites for tackling antimicrobial resistance and its applicability across diverse industries.","",""

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was applied to characterize the four different propolis extracts. Cytotoxicity and radiation survival were determined by 3D matrix-based clonogenic assays and autophagy was examined by western blotting. We found cytotoxicity in a propolis type-, time- and cell model- dependent manner. In the four ethanolic propolis extracts, Coumaric acid, Caffeic acid phenethyl ester, Pinocembrin and Chrysin presented the major compounds identified. Examining the induction of autophagy using the marker LC3B and autophagy inhibition with chloroquine suggested autophagy to be part of the survival mechanisms upon propolis treatment in a cell model-dependent manner.

Edible coatings have attracted attention as a packaging method that can prolong the shelf life of meat. The study aimed to examine the impact of a combination of Lepidium sativum mucilage (LS) coating and propolis extract (PE) on prolonging the shelf life of buffalo meat. The chemical characteristics (chemical compounds, total phenol content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidant activity, and cytotoxicity) and antimicrobial activity of the PE (disk diffusion agar, well diffusion agar, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration) were investigated. The effect of the PE on the cell wall of pathogenic bacteria was examined using a scanning electron microscope. Biological properties of LS (TPC, TFC, antioxidant activity and antimicrobial effect (pour plate method)) was investigated. Different concentrations of PE (0, 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5%) were added to the coating mixture containing LS, and their effects on extending the shelf life of buffalo meat samples stored at 4°C for 9 days were assessed. The PE included gallic acid, benzoic acid, syringic acid, 4-3 dimethoxy cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, myricetin, caffeic acid, luteolin, chlorogenic acid, and apigenin. The PE was determined to have a TPC of 36.67 ± 0.57 mg GAE/g and a TFC of 48.02 ± 0.65 mg QE/g. The extract's radical scavenging activity ranged from 0 to 76.22% for DPPH radicals and from 0 to 50.31% for ABTS radicals. The viability of C115 HeLa cell was observed to be 94.14 μg/mL. The PE and LS, exhibited strong antimicrobial properties against pathogenic bacteria. The LS was determined to have a TPC of 15.23 ± 0.43 mg GAE/g and a TFC of 11.51± 0.61 mg QE/g. The LS was determined to have a DPPH of 429.65 ± 1.28 μg/mL and a ABTS of 403.59 ± 1.46 μg/mL. The microbiological analysis revealed that the LS+2.5%PE treatment was the most effective in inhibiting the growth of total viable count (6.23 vs. 8.00 log CFU/g), psychrotrophic bacteria count (3.71 vs. 4.73 log CFU/g), coliforms count (2.78 vs. 3.70 log CFU/g), and fungi count (2.39 vs. 3.93 log CFU/g) compared to the control sample. The addition of PE to the edible coating also demonstrated a concentration-dependent effect on preserving the moisture, pH, color, and hardness of the buffalo meat. Sensory evaluation results suggested that incorporating PE into the edible coating extended the shelf life of buffalo meat by three days. In the second stage of this paper, this investigation employed two distinct forecasting methodologies: the Radial Basis Function (RBF) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict a range of quality indicators for coated meat products. Upon comparison, the RBF model exhibited a higher level of accuracy, showcasing its exceptional capacity to closely match the experimental outcomes. Therefore, this type of food coating, renowned for its strong antimicrobial properties, has the potential to effectively package and preserve perishable and delicate food items, such as meat.","",""

The selected NADESs' extractability was evaluated by measuring the concentrations of total phenolics and total flavones and flavonols in the propolis extracts obtained, which qualitative chemical composition was further determined in detail by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. It demonstrated that the chemical profiles of NADES and 70% ethanolic propolis extracts are similar. To expand the knowledge about the role of the applied solvents in the poplar propolis extraction process, the in vitro antimicrobial, cytotoxic and genotoxic activity of both NADESs and liquid NADES extracts were evaluated. The results revealed that the use of the selected NADESs as an extraction media for phenolic compounds from poplar propolis not only delivered a good extraction yield in some cases, but generally led to the preservation of propolis extracts' biological activity and even to the enhancement of their antimicrobial effect in comparison with the hydroethanolic one. Besides, the tested NADESs except for lactic acid:fructose and betaine:malic acid:water exerted low to negligible toxicity against normal cells treated and apart from lactic acid:fructose the remaining solvents demonstrated concentration-dependent moderate to subtle genotoxicity. There is a probability that not the supramolecular structure of the NADESs, but their components, played a key role for the observed biological effects. The present study has demonstrated an alternative approach for extracting the biologically active complex from poplar type propolis using NADESs, which could be useful for further pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical applications.","",""

This study aimed to explore a new approach to improve in vitro biological response in terms of antimicrobial activity and cell proliferation by taking advantage of additive manufacturing for the development of scaffolds with complex geometries by 3D printing using propolis-modified wollastonite. The scaffolds were designed with a TPMS (Triply Periodic Minimal Surface) gyroid geometric shape and 3D printed prior to impregnation with propolis extract. The paste formulation was characterized by rheometric measurements, and the presence of propolis was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. The scaffolds were comprehensively assessed for their mechanical strength. The biological characterization involved evaluating the antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, employing Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), Zone of Inhibition (ZOI), and biofilm formation assays. Additionally, SaOs-2 cultures were used to study cell proliferation (Alamar blue assay), and potential osteogenic was tested (von Kossa, Alizarin Red, and ALP stainings) at different time points. Propolis impregnation did not compromise the mechanical properties of the scaffolds, which exhibited values comparable to human trabecular bone. Propolis incorporation conferred antibacterial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The implementation of TPMS gyroid geometry in the scaffold design demonstrated favorable cell proliferation with increased metabolic activity and osteogenic potential after 21 days of cell cultures.","",""

However, NC has no bactericidal activity, which is a critical need for the effective prevention of infections in chronic diabetic wound dressing applications. Therefore, in this work, a natural product, propolis extract (PE), was used as an antibacterial agent, in different amounts, together with NC to obtain sponge-like structures (NC/PE). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed well-impregnated cellulose fibers and a more compact structure with the addition of PE. According to the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the samples containing PE underwent thermal degradation before the unmodified NC due to the presence of volatile compounds in the extract. However, the peak degradation temperature in the first derivative thermogravimetric curves was higher for all the sponges containing PE when compared to the unmodified NC. The antibacterial efficacy of the samples was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, as well as on two clinically resistant isolates. The samples completely inhibited the development of Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was partially inhibited, while Escherichia coli was resistant to the PE action.

The objective of the conducted study was to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of the Polish ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) and isolated CAPE on stimulated with LPS and IFN-α, as well as the combination of LPS and IFN-α. The cytotoxicity of the tested compounds was determined using the MTT assay.

In the tested concentrations, both CAPE and EEP did not exert cytotoxic effects. Our results demonstrate that CAPE reduces TNF-α and IL-6 in contrast to EEP. Propolis seems effective in stimulating HGF-1 to release IL-6 and IL-8. A statistically significant difference was observed for IL-8 in HGF-1 stimulated by LPS+IFN-α and treated EEP at a concentration of 50 µg/mL (p = 0.021201).

MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), minimal inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, minimum fungicidal concentration, biofilm formation, and degradation tests were studied to clarify the oral antimicrobial properties of green synthesized TiO2  NPs. According to the FTIR analysis, the propolis extract contained flavonoids and phenolic compounds in addition to TiO2 NPs. Additionally, UV-Vis revealed that intense bands had formed NPs. EDX spectra and SEM images revealed that the stabilizing agent was in perfect quasi-spherical shapes around 21 nm. An EDX spectrum was used to verify the presence of titanium and oxygen. There were no significant cytotoxicity effects. The antibacterial results showed that Pro1TiO2 (Khalkhal sample) had better effects than Pro2TiO2 (Gilan sample) and TiO2 NPs. The present study presents a new process for synthesizing TiO2 NPs from propolis extracts with less toxic effects and user-friendly, eco-friendly, and economical materials. Pro1TiO2 NPs may be considered the best candidate for clinical application.","",""

Green tea, bilberry, dried pomegranate peel, and propolis extracts were selected for this purpose. Cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of each component, as well as the developed chewable tablet, were examined against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus using Vero E6 cells with the xCELLigence real-time cell analyser-multiple plates system. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities, as well as mutagenicity and anti-mutagenicity of the chewable tablet were also analysed. Compared to the control, it was observed that the chewable tablet at concentrations of 110 and 55 µg/mL had antiviral activity rates of 101% and 81%, respectively, for the Wuhan variant and 112% and 35%, respectively, for the Omicron variant. The combination of herbal extracts with propolis extract were synergically more effective (∼7-fold higher) than that of individual extract. The present work suggests that a combination of herbal extracts with propolis at suitable concentrations can effectively be used as a food supplement for the prevention of both variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the oral cavity (the first entry point of the SARS-CoV-2 virus).","",""

Method and Materials. Propolis was sampled and extracted. Green synthesis of CuO NPs was synthesized and characterized using SEM, TEM, DLS, BET, and zeta potential methods. L. acidophilus (ATCC 4356) was used, and the antimicrobial tests were carried out at different concentrations (10≥ mg/ml). Moreover, the cytotoxicity was evaluated using an MTT assay on human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK). Synthesized CuO NPs using propolis extracts from Khalkhal (sample 1) and Gillan (sample 2) showed -13.2 and -14.4 mV, respectively. The hydrodynamic sizes of well-dispersed samples 1 and 2 were 3124.9 nm and 1726.7 nm, respectively. According to BET analysis, samples 1 and 2 had 5.37 and 8.45 m2/g surface area, respectively.

WSLs seem to be a multi-factorial interaction including increased microbial plaque due to intrabuccal appliances that limit the oral-cleansing mechanism and change in the oral microbiome during fixed appliance wear. The aim of this study was to investigate the synergistic effect of propolis quantum dots (PQD), nisin (Nis), and quercetin nanoparticles (nQCT)-mediated photodynamic therapy (PQD-Nis-nQCT-mediated aPDT) in the eradication of Streptococcus mutans biofilms and the remineralization of WSLs ex-vivo. The cytotoxicity of PQD-Nis-nQCT composite on human gingival fibroblasts was evaluated using neutral red. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation following PQD-Nis-nQCT-mediated aPDT was measured. Enamel slabs were prepared and demineralized using a demineralization solution containing S. mutans. Demineralized enamel slabs were divided into 9 groups (n = 10) and treated in the following groups: 1) Artificial saliva (negative control), 2) 2% neutral sodium fluoride gel (NSF; positive control or treatment control, 3) PQD, 4) Nis, 5) nQCT, 6) Nis-nQCT, 7) PQD-Nis-nQCT 8) Blue laser irradiation (light), 9) PQD-Nis-nQCT with irradiation (PQD-Nis-nQCT-mediated aPDT). Then, the surface changes, microhardness, and surface topography of the demineralized slabs were examined following each treatment using DIAGNOdent Pen reading, digital hardness tester, and SEM, respectively. After the determination of minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of PQD, Nis, and nQCT by microtiter plate assay, the synergistic antimicrobial effects of PQD and Nis-nQCT were determined via evaluation of fractional biofilm eradication concentration (FBEC) index. The anti-biofilm effects of each treatment on S. mutans were assessed using a colorimetric assay. The virulence‑associated gtfB gene expression was assessed following PQD-Nis-nQCT-mediated aPDT by quantitative real‑time PCR. PQD-Nis-nQCT at 2048 µg/mL had no significant cell cytotoxicity on human gingival fibroblasts compared to the control group (P > 0.05). A significantly increased (7.6 fold) in intracellular ROS was observed following PQD-Nis-nQCT-mediated aPDT (13.9 ± 1.41) when compared to the control (1.83 ± 0.13). Following each treatment, the microhardness of the demineralized enamel surface significantly increased except for the artificial saliva (negative) and blue laser irradiation groups. The highest change in microhardness improvement was detected in the PQD-Nis-nQCT-mediated aPDT group (P < 0.05). Also, DIAGNODent Pen reading revealed the highest significant improved change in the level of mineralization degree in the PQD-Nis-nQCT-mediated aPDT group. Nis and blue light irradiation groups, like the artificial saliva-treated demineralized enamel slabs (control group), did not lead to remineralization (P > 0.05). Also, the PQD-Nis-nQCT-mediated aPDT treatment results obtained from SEM revealed that remineralization of demineralized enamel slabs in that group has significantly improved compared to the others. Light-activated nQCT, PQD, Nis-nQCT, and PQD-Nis-nQCT composite significantly reduced pre-formed biofilms of S. mutans compared with unactivated forms of test materials. The relative expression level of the virulence gtfB gene was significantly decreased (7.53-fold) in the presence of PQD-Nis-nQCT-mediated aPDT (P < 0.05). PQD-Nis-nQCT-mediated aPDT can be used for the eradication of S. mutans biofilms and remineralization of WSLs. The found in vitro efficacy should be tested further through clinical studies.","",""

In this survey, we sought to investigate issues related to the botanical and geographic description of the species, the ethnobotanical uses, as well as the phytochemical studies of the essential oil, extracts and green propolis obtained from the aerial parts and roots of B. dracunculifolia. Using high precision analytical tools, numerous compounds have already been isolated and identified from leaves and flowers such as the flavonoids: naringenin, acacetin, dihydrokaempferol, isosakuranetin and kaempferide; phenolic acids: p-coumaric, dihydrocoumaric, ferulic (E)-cinnamic, hydroxycinnamic, gallic, caffeic, and several caffeoylquinic acids derivatives; phenolic acids prenylated: artepillin C, baccharin, drupanin; the glycosides dracuculifosides and the pentacyclic triterpenoids: Baccharis oxide and friedelanol. The predominant class in the essential oil of leaves and flowers are terpenoids comprising oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, highlighting the compounds nerolidol, spathulenol, germacrene D and bicyclogermacrene. These compounds give the species high antimicrobial, antioxidant, antitumor, analgesic, immunomodulatory and antiparasitic potential, making this species a promising herbal medicine.

We found that PEO has antibacterial effects against S. mutans by decreasing bacterial viability within the biofilm, as demonstrated by the XTT assay, live/dead staining assay, LDH activity assay, and leakage of calcium ions. Furthermore, PEO also suppresses the total of biofilm biomasses and damages the biofilm structure. The underlying mechanisms involved may be related to inhibiting bacterial adhesion and GTFs activity, resulting in decreased production of EPSs. In addition, a CCK8 assay suggests that PEO has no cytotoxicity on normal oral epithelial cells.

Membranes were extensively characterized to assess the thickness, pH, morphology using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), mechanical properties, swelling, in vitro mucoadhesion, cytotoxicity, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Assessment of the thickness and mechanical properties of the membranes containing HERP revealed that the most significant thickness obtained was 40.7 μm; thermal analysis suggests suggesting the hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups of isoflavones and the free amine present in the region of chitosan. Cell viability decreased as the amount of HERP increased. Finally, the MICs were 7.8 and 1.9 μg.mL-1 for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, respectively.

Therefore, bilayer wound dressings which are composed of two layers with different properties have gained lots of attention. In the present study, polycaprolactone/gelatin (PCL/Gel) scaffold was electrospun on a dense membrane composed of polyurethane and ethanolic extract of propolis (PU/EEP). The PU/EEP membrane was used as the top layer to protect the wound area from external contamination and dehydration, while the PCL/Gel scaffold was used as the sublayer to facilitate cells' adhesion and proliferation. The bilayer wound dressing was investigated regarding its microstructure, mechanical properties, surface wettability, anti-bacterial activity, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and its efficacy in the animal wound model and histopathological analyzes. Scanning electron micrographs exhibited uniform morphology and bead-free structure of the PCL/Gel scaffold with average fibers' diameter of 237.3 ± 65.1 nm. Significant anti-bacterial activity was observed against Staphylococcal aureus (5.4 ± 0.3 mm), Escherichia coli (1.9 ± 0.4 mm) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1.0 ± 0.2 mm) according to inhibition zone test. The bilayer wound dressing exhibited high hydrophilicity (51.1 ± 4.9°), biodegradability, and biocompatibility. The bilayer wound dressing could significantly accelerate the wound closure and collagen deposition in the Wistar rats' skin wound model. Taking together, the PU/EEP-PCL/Gel bilayer wound dressing can be a potential candidate for biomedical applications due to remarkable mechanical properties, biocompatibility, antibacterial features, and wound healing activities.","",""

The cells were treated with ethanolic PE at various concentrations for 24 hours, after which the total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status; malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, and glutathione (GSH) levels; Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) activity; and apoptotic markers were measured. Ethanolic PE at 100, 250, and 500 μg/mL concentrations showed optimal activity on C6 glioma cells. TAS and GSH levels were significantly increased in C6 glioma cells treated with 100 and 500 μg/mL PE compared to control cells (P < .05). Similarly, the activity of Cu/Zn-SOD was higher in C6 glioma cells treated with 250 or 500 μg/mL ethanolic PE compared to control cells (P < .05), as was the caspase-3 mRNA expression level. The highest levels of caspase-8 and -9 expression were in C6 glioma cells treated with 500 μg/mL PE.

The antioxidant potential of CAPE was investigated in relation H2O2-induced oxidative stress in the both neoplastic cells and PBLs. CAPE expressed cytotoxic, genotoxic, and pro-apoptotic activity against AGS, HCT116, and HT29 tumor cells. CAPE, in the presence of different concentrations of irinotecan or SN38, decreased the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and pro-apoptotic activity in these cell lines, but it has no such action on normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes.","",""
