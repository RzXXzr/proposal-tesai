Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) addresses these defects using barrier membranes that block soft tissue infiltration and promote bone growth. CollaTape®, a type I bovine collagen membrane, is widely used for its biocompatibility and resorbability, though its bioactivity and antibacterial properties could be improved. This study compares two functionalization methods for enhancing CollaTape® membranes: adsorption of GBMP1α peptide (a BMP-2 biomimetic) and covalent anchoring of its analogue Aoa-GBMP1α. Both functionalizations were performed at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/mL. Optimal conditions were selected basing on osteoblast mineralization assays and resulted to be 0.25 mg/mL for adsorption and 1.5 mg/mL for covalent binding. Peptide surface density analysis revealed values of 0.040 μmol/cm² for adsorption and 0.278 μmol/cm² for covalent anchoring. Biological assays assessed mineralization, proliferation, and gene expression (SPP1, RUNX2) in human osteoblasts, and antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. All functionalized membranes improved osteoblast activity, with adsorption showing superior results. Antibacterial tests showed slight but significant reductions in bacterial colonies, especially for adsorption. Additional mechanical tests via unconfined compression were performed to evaluate the effect of functionalization on the membranes' mechanical properties. These tests confirmed that neither functionalization method compromised the stiffness of the membrane, a critical parameter in clinical applications. Overall, peptide adsorption is a simple and clinically adaptable strategy to enhance CollaTape®'s bioactivity and antibacterial properties while maintaining their original mechanical properties.&#xD.","",""

During hydrolysis, α-TCP releases calcium (Ca²⁺) and phosphate (PO₄³⁻) ions that actively promote tissue mineralization, making it particularly valuable for applications in periodontal bone repair, periapical lesion treatment, and dental hard tissue remineralization. However, while α-TCP demonstrates excellent initial osteogenic activity, its rapid degradation kinetics in physiological environments often lead to premature structural collapse, localized hyperphosphatemia, and inconsistent bone formation outcomes. This review examines the current applications of α-TCP in oral medicine, with particular focus on its clinical use in apexification, alveolar ridge preservation, and guided bone regeneration. We critically analyse the material's limitations, including its mechanical instability in load-bearing sites and unpredictable resorption profiles that may hinder long-term regenerative outcomes. Emerging strategies to overcome these challenges are discussed, such as the development of composite systems combining α-TCP with β-TCP, hydroxyapatite, or biodegradable polymers to achieve optimized degradation rates and enhanced mechanical performance. Furthermore, we explore innovative approaches in material design, including surface functionalization with bioactive molecules and the fabrication of three-dimensional printed (3D-printed) α-TCP scaffolds with controlled porosity. The review concludes by identifying key research directions for the field, emphasizing the need for improved in vivo degradation models, standardized clinical evaluation protocols, and the development of smart α-TCP composites capable of spatiotemporal control over ion release. By addressing these challenges, α-TCP-based materials may realize their full potential as next-generation solutions for oral tissue engineering and regenerative dentistry. Furthermore, this review uniquely synthesizes the literature by grouping findings according to key performance outcomes - including mechanical strength, degradation kinetics, and osteogenic efficacy - to provide a clear, comparative analysis of how different material design strategies directly influence biological and functional results.","",""

Consequently, surface modification is essential to enhance the osseointegrative capacity of titanium implants. We fabricated hydroxyapatite-graphene oxide (HA-GO) coatings via electrochemical deposition and systematically compared four distinct protein loading methods. Ultimately, we developed a hydroxyapatite-graphene oxide/interleukin-4 (Ti@HA-GO@IL-4) coating on pure titanium substrates to investigate its physicochemical properties and biocompatibility. The composite coating was successfully fabricated on pure titanium substrates, inducing significant surface modifications including the incorporation of bioactive functional groups, enhanced hydrophilicity, and altered surface morphology.

This review systematically describes key engineering strategies-from ion doping and nanocomposite integration to surface modification-that synergistically endow SFNs with potent antibacterial, immunomodulatory, and osteoinductive properties. Furthermore, smart SFN systems responsive to pH, enzymes, or light stimuli enable targeted drug delivery and precise infection control. Mechanistically, we highlight how SFNs orchestrate an ordered transition of the infected microenvironment from a pro-inflammatory to a pro-reparative state by regulating key signaling pathways such as NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and BMP/Smad. Although preclinical results are promising, critical hurdles to clinical translation remain, including batch-to-batch consistency, sterilization compatibility, and scalable manufacturing.

Transcriptomic changes following xHyA treatment were also investigated. SaOS-2 cells were cultured on NPCM and RCCM, with or without xHyA functionalization. Cytocompatibility, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mineralization (Von Kossa staining), and RNA sequencing were assessed. Differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted on cells exposed to two xHyA concentrations. Both membrane types supported cell viability, though NPCM allowed cellular infiltration while RCCM maintained barrier integrity. xHyA significantly enhanced ALP activity and mineral deposition across both substrates. RNA sequencing revealed minimal upregulation of classical osteogenic genes but identified differential expression in pathways related to focal adhesion, VEGF signaling, and stem cell differentiation. IGF1R, FYN, and MAPK14 were consistently upregulated regardless of xHyA concentration. xHyA functionalization enhances osteogenic activity, evidenced by increased ALP and mineralization, likely via modulation of cell-matrix interactions rather than classical osteogenic gene activation.

PCL nanofibers were produced via electrospinning, and Cu2+ ions were introduced through PDA-mediated surface modification to enable pH-responsive binding and controlled release. The material's physicochemical properties were evaluated through structural analysis, mechanical testing, and release kinetics. Biological performance was tested using antibacterial assays and osteoblast (MC3T3-E1) cell cultures, including assessments of cell proliferation and key osteogenic gene expression (Runx2, Osx, ALP, OCN).

Mg-NW-Ti was effectively synthesized through a series of chemical reactivity tests, and its morphology, roughness, hydrophilicity, elemental composition, and ion release were characterized. The biological effects of Mg-NW-Ti on MC3T3-E1 cells were assessed and compared with commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) and nanowire-modified titanium (NW-Ti). In addition, a peri-implant bone defect model of rabbit mandibular alveolar bone was constructed to evaluate the effects of Mg-NW-Ti mesh on bone regeneration and osseointegration of the implant. The resultant Ti surface appeared as a nanowire structure under scanning electron microscopy with higher surface roughness and hydrophilicity compared to the CP-Ti. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ion release analysis demonstrated successful loading of magnesium ions onto the titanium surface and effective release into the surroundings. In vitro Mg-NW-Ti exhibited good biocompatibility and significantly enhanced proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1, while the results of the in vivo study demonstrated that the Mg-NW-Ti mesh exhibited a beneficial impact on bone regeneration and implant osseointegration. In conclusion, this novel surface modification of titanium mesh may serve as an effective strategy for optimizing the osteogenic functionality of titanium mesh and harnessing its potential for increased application value.","",""

The barrier membrane showed good antibacterial performance against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria owing to the antibacterial activity of chitosan and the added chlorhexidine acetate. Furthermore, the barrier membrane met the requirements of biocompatibility for implanted biomaterials.

To date, commercial surgical meshes are typically made of non-absorbable synthetic polymers, notably polypropylene and polytetrafluoroethylene, which are associated with postoperative complications, such as infections. Biological meshes, based on native tissues, have been employed to overcome such complications, though mechanical strength has been a main disadvantage. The right balance in mechanical and biological performances has been achieved by the advent of bioresorbable meshes. Despite improvements, recurrence of clinical complications associated with surgical meshes raises significant concerns regarding the technical adequacy of current materials and designs, pointing to a crucial need for further development. To this end, current research focuses on the design of meshes capable of biomimicking native tissue and facilitating the healing process without post-operative complications. Researchers are actively investigating advanced bioresorbable materials, both synthetic polymers and natural biopolymers, while also exploring the performance of therapeutic agents, surface modification methods and advanced manufacturing technologies such as 4D printing. This review seeks to evaluate emerging biomaterials and technologies for enhancing the performance and clinical applicability of the next-generation surgical meshes. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In the ever-transforming landscape of regenerative medicine, the embracing of engineered bioabsorbable surgical meshes stands as a key milestone in addressing persistent challenges and complications associated with existing treatments. The urgency to move beyond conventional non-absorbable meshes, fraught with post-surgery complications, emphasises the necessity of using advanced biomaterials for engineered tissue regeneration. This review critically examines the growing field of absorbable surgical meshes, considering their potential to transform clinical practice. By strategically combining mechanical strength with bioresorbable characteristics, these innovative meshes hold the promise of mitigating complications and improving patient outcomes across diverse medical applications. As we navigate the complexities of modern medicine, this exploration of engineered absorbable meshes emerges as a promising approach, offering an overall perspective on biomaterials, technologies, and strategies adopted to redefine the future of surgical meshes.","",""

To achieve a good prognosis for implant-supported restorations, adequate peri-implant bone volume is mandatory. The Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) technique is one of the most applied methods for alveolar bone reconstruction and treatment of peri-implant bone deficiencies. This technique involves the use of different types of membranes in association with some bone substitutes (autologous, homologous, or heterologous). However, time for bone regeneration is often too long and the bone quality is not simply predictable. This study aims at engineering and evaluating the efficacy of modified barrier membranes, enhancing their bioactivity for improved alveolar bone tissue regeneration. We investigated membranes functionalized with chitosan (CS) and chitosan combined with the peptide GBMP1α (CS + GBMP1α), to improve bone growth. OsseoGuard® membranes, derived from bovine Achilles tendon type I collagen crosslinked with formaldehyde, were modified using CS and CS + GBMP1α. The functionalization, carried out with 1-ethyl-3-(3 dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and sulfo-N-Hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/sulfo-NHS), was assessed through FT-IR and XPS analyses. Biological assays were performed by directly seeding human osteoblasts onto the materials to assess cell proliferation, mineralization, gene expression of Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and Runt-Related Transcription Factor 2 (Runx2), and antibacterial properties. Both CS and CS + GBMP1α functionalizations significantly enhanced human osteoblast proliferation, mineralization, gene expression, and antibacterial activity compared to commercial membranes. The CS + GBMP1α functionalization exhibited superior outcomes in all biological assays. Mechanical tests showed no significant alterations of membrane biomechanical properties post-functionalization. The engineered membranes, especially those functionalized with CS + GBMP1α, are suitable for GBR applications thanks to their ability to enhance osteoblast activity and promote bone tissue regeneration.

Its main purpose is to prevent the migration of soft tissue into the osseous wound space, while allowing osseous cells to migrate to the site. GBR is classified into two main categories: resorbable and non-resorbable membranes. Resorbable membranes do not require a second surgery but tend to have a short resorption period. Conversely, non-resorbable membranes maintain their mechanical strength and prevent collapse. However, they require removal and are susceptible to membrane exposure. GBR is often used with bone substitute graft materials to fill the defect space and protect the bone graft. The membrane can also undergo various modifications, such as surface modification and biological factor loading, to improve barrier functions and bone regeneration. In addition, bone regeneration is largely related to osteoimmunology, a new field that focuses on the interactions between bone and the immune system. Understanding these interactions can help in developing new treatments for bone diseases and injuries. Overall, GBR has the potential to be a powerful tool in promoting bone regeneration. Further research in this area could lead to advancements in the field of bone healing.

Placement of a cage in the intervertebral space has become a routine clinical treatment for spinal fusion surgery to provide sufficient biomechanical stability, which is required to achieve bony ingrowth of the implant. Routinely used cages for clinical application are made of titanium (Ti) or polyetheretherketone (PEEK). Ti has been used since the 1980s; however, its shortcomings, such as impaired radiographical opacity and higher elastic modulus compared to bone, have led to the development of PEEK cages, which are associated with reduced stress shielding as well as no radiographical artefacts. Since PEEK is bioinert, its osteointegration capacity is limited, which in turn enhances fibrotic tissue formation and peri-implant infections. To address shortcomings of both of these biomaterials, interdisciplinary teams have developed biodegradable cages. Rooted in promising preclinical large animal studies, a hollow cylindrical cage (Hydrosorb™) made of 70:30 poly-l-lactide-co-d, l-lactide acid (PLDLLA) was clinically studied. However, reduced bony integration and unfavourable long-term clinical outcomes prohibited its routine clinical application. More recently, scaffold-guided bone regeneration (SGBR) with application of highly porous biodegradable constructs is emerging. Advancements in additive manufacturing technology now allow the cage designs that match requirements, such as stiffness of surrounding tissues, while providing long-term biomechanical stability. A favourable clinical outcome has been observed in the treatment of various bone defects, particularly for 3D-printed composite scaffolds made of medical-grade polycaprolactone (mPCL) in combination with a ceramic filler material. Therefore, advanced cage design made of mPCL and ceramic may also carry initial high spinal forces up to the time of bony fusion and subsequently resorb without clinical side effects. Furthermore, surface modification of implants is an effective approach to simultaneously reduce microbial infection and improve tissue integration. We present a design concept for a scaffold surface which result in osteoconductive and antimicrobial properties that have the potential to achieve higher rates of fusion and less clinical complications. In this review, we explore the preclinical and clinical studies which used bioresorbable cages. Furthermore, we critically discuss the need for a cutting-edge research program that includes comprehensive preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies to enable successful translation from bench to bedside.

Thus, within this study, four different variants of biomaterials were evaluated, namely: poly (D,L-lactic acid)/poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) biomaterial, poly(D,L-lactic acid)/poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)/nano hydroxyapatite biomaterial, poly (D,L-lactic acid)/poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)/nano zinc oxide-silver biomaterial, and poly (D,L-lactic acid)/poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)/nano hydroxyapatite/nano zinc oxide-silver biomaterial. First, it was demonstrated that the wettability of biomaterials-a prerequisite property important for ensuring desired biological response-was highly increased after the sonocoating process. Moreover, it was indicated that biomaterials composed of poly (D,L-lactic acid)/poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) with or without a nano hydroxyapatite layer allowed proper osteoblast growth and proliferation, but did not have antibacterial properties. Addition of a nano zinc oxide-silver layer to the biomaterial inhibited growth of bacterial cells around the membrane, but at the same time induced very high cytotoxicity towards osteoblasts. Most importantly, enrichment of this biomaterial with a supplementary underlayer of nano hydroxyapatite allowed for the preservation of antibacterial properties and also a decrease in the cytotoxicity towards bone cells, associated with the presence of a nano zinc oxide-silver layer. Thus, the final structure of the composite poly (D,L-lactic acid)/poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)/nano hydroxyapatite/nano zinc oxide-silver seems to be a promising construct for tissue engineering products, especially guided tissue regeneration/guided bone regeneration membranes. Nevertheless, additional research is needed in order to improve the developed construct, which will simultaneously protect the biomaterial from bacterial colonization and enhance the bone regeneration properties.","",""

The mechanical properties of these novel membranes were similar to other commercially available barrier membranes. In contrast, the adhesion of our membranes towards bone was by far superior (i.e. 62-fold) compared to conventional commercially available Bio-Gide® membranes. Moreover, alendronate-functionalized membranes retained their bone-adhesive properties under wet conditions in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solutions with and without collagenase. Finally, the in vitro degradation of the membranes was studied by monitoring their weight loss upon immersion in PBS solutions with and without collagenase. The membranes degraded in a sustained manner, which was accelerated by the presence of collagenase due to enzymatic degradation of the carrier. In conclusion, our results show that surface functionalization of barrier membranes with alendronate moieties renders them adhesive to bone. As such, the biomaterials design strategy presented herein opens up new avenues of research on bone-adhesive membranes for guided bone regeneration.","",""

Biodegradable metals (BMs) is a promising bioactive materials to treat oral and maxillofacial diseases. This review summarizes the research status and future research directions of BMs for oral and maxillofacial applications. Mg-based BMs and Zn-based BMs for bone fracture fixation systems, and guided bone regeneration (GBR) membranes, are discussed in detail. Zn-based BMs with a moderate degradation rate and superior mechanical properties for GBR membranes show great potential for clinical translation. Fe-based BMs have a relatively low degradation rate and insoluble degradation products, which greatly limit their application and clinical translation. Furthermore, we proposed potential future research directions for BMs in the oral and maxillofacial regions, including 3D printed BM bone scaffolds, surface modification for BMs GBR membranes, and BMs containing hydrogels for cartilage regeneration, soft tissue regeneration, and nerve regeneration. Taken together, the progress made in the development of BMs in oral and maxillofacial regions has laid a foundation for further clinical translation.","",""

Calcium phosphates (CaPs) were coated on the surface of pure Mg through a simple alkali-hydrothermal treatment. The surface properties of CaP coatings formed on Mg were identified through wettability, direct cell seeding, and release tests since the surface properties of biomaterials can affect the reaction of the host tissue. The effect of CaP-coated Mg mesh on guided bone regeneration in rat calvaria with the critical-size defect was also evaluated in vivo using several comprehensive analyses in comparison with untreated Mg mesh. Following the application of protective CaP coating, the surface energy of Mg improved with higher hydrophilicity and cell affinity. At the same time, the CaP coating endowed Mg with higher Ca affinity and lower degradation. The Mg mesh with CaP coating had higher osteointegration and bone affinity than pristine Mg mesh.","",""

Here, the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been introduced as a feasible platform for multifactorial control of cell-substrate interaction, given the wide range of physical and mechanical properties of MOF materials and their structural flexibility. In situ crystallization of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) on the polydopamine (PDA)-modified membrane significantly raised surface energy, wettability, roughness, and stiffness of the substrate. This modulation led to an almost twofold increment in the primary attachment of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) compare to conventional plastic culture dishes. The findings indicate that polypropylene (PP) membrane modified by PDA/ZIF-8 coating effectively supports the growth and proliferation of DPSCs at a substantial rate. Further analysis also displayed the exaggerated multilineage differentiation of DPSCs with amplified level of autocrine cell fate determination signals, like BSP1, BMP2, PPARG, FABP4, ACAN, and COL2A. Notably, osteogenic markers were dramatically overexpressed (more than 100-folds rather than tissue culture plate) in response to biomechanical characteristics of the ZIF-8 layer. Hence, surface modification of cell culture platforms with MOF nanostructures proposed as a powerful nanomedical approach for selectively guiding stem cells for tissue regeneration. In particular, PP/PDA/ZIF-8 membrane presented ideal characteristics for using as a barrier membrane for guided bone regeneration (GBR) in periodontal tissue engineering.","",""

Given the biological responses following implantation, GBR process originates from an early inflammation-driven reaction adjacent to implanted membranes surface. However, to date there is relatively little attention paid to the critical immunoregulatory functions in traditionally designed GBR membranes. Herein, for the first time, we manipulate immunomodulatory properties of the widely-used native small intestinal submucosa (SIS) membrane by incorporating strontium-substituted nanohydroxyapatite coatings and/or IFN-γ to its surface. In vitro results reveal the obtained novel membrane SIS/SrHA/IFN-γ not only promote functions of endothelial cells and osteoblasts directly, but also energetically mediate a sequential M1-M2 macrophages transition to concurrently facilitate angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Moreover, in vivo outcomes of subcutaneous implantation and cranial defects repair further confirm its superior capacity to promote vascularization and in situ bone regeneration than pristine SIS through immunomodulation. These results demonstrate a sequential immunomodulatory strategy renders modified SIS membranes acting as a robust immunomodulator rather than a traditional barrier to significantly ameliorate in vivo GBR outcomes and hence provide important implications that may facilitate concerns on immunomodulatory properties for future GBR developments.","",""

To this end, a series of HA derivatives with different aliphatic tails (DD-Cx mol% ≈ 12.0 mol%) and decreasing derivatization of free amino groups (DDEDA mol% from 70.0 to 30.0 mol%) were first synthesized, namely Hn. Then dexamethasone-loaded Hn EM, i.e. HnX were prepared from aqueous polymeric solutions with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), as a non-ionogenic linear flexible polymeric carrier, and the multifunctional 2-hydroxypropyl- cyclodextrin (HPCD) which acted as a rheological modifier, a stabilizer of Taylor's cone, and a solubilizing agent. A comprehensive characterization of the membranes was carried out through ATR-IR, XRD, and WCA measurements. According to the in vitro hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation and drug release in different aqueous media for two months, the insertion of alkyl pendant grafts and the crosslinking process provided tuneable additional resistance to the whole membrane suitably for the final application of the membranes.

Following surgical exposure of the calvarium, 4 customized titanium cylindricalders were fixed. Surface modification was achieved by application of APCP on 2 of cylinders (P+) in each calvarium and other cylinders were set as control (P-). In both experimental and control groups, one of the cylinders was filled with bone graft (G+) while the other one was left empty (G-). To evaluate short term effects, randomly selected 6 animals were sacrificed at the end of 45 days and remaining 6 animals were left for observing long term effects. Histological and μCT evaluations were used to examine new bone formation. In μCT imaging; the bone volume was greater (P < 0.05) in grafted groups than nongrafted groups in both short and long term. The bone height values were significantly different in (P-G-) group than other groups (P < 0.05) in both evaluation periods.

The barrier membrane prevents pathogens and epithelial cells to invade the bone augmentation site, thereby permitting osteoblasts to deposit minerals and build up bone. This study aims at adding bioactive properties to otherwise inert PTFE membranes in order to enhance cell adherence and promote proliferation. A prewetting by ethanol and stepwise hydration protocol was herein employed to overcome high surface tension of PTFE membranes and allow for a recombinant spider silk protein, functionalized with a cell-binding motif from fibronectin (FN-silk), to self-assemble into a nanofibrillar coating. HaCaT and U-2 OS cells were seeded onto soft and hard tissue sides, respectively, of membranes coated with FN-silk. The cells could firmly adhere as early as 1 h post seeding, as well as markedly grow in numbers when kept in culture for 7 days. Fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy images revealed that adherent cells could form a confluent monolayer and develop essential cell-cell contacts during 1 week of culture. Hence, functionalized PTFE membranes have a potential of better integration at the implantation site, with reduced risk of membrane displacement as well as exposure to oral pathogens.","",""
