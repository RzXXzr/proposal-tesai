Three-dimensional (3D) printed scaffolds with (group M) or without (group S) Matrigel coating were implanted under the feeding vessels of the platysma in New Zealand White rabbits (n = 3) to induce vascularization. After 1 or 2 weeks, tracheal defects were created and vascularized scaffolds with feeders of the platysma were transplanted as rotational flaps. As controls, scaffolds with or without Matrigel coating was transplanted into a tracheal defect without prevascularization. Airway patency and epithelization were examined using a rigid bronchoscope every 2 weeks. Surviving animals were euthanized at 24 weeks, and microcomputed tomography and histological evaluation were performed. Animals with 2 weeks of prevascularization showed longer survival than animals with 0 or 1 weeks of prevascularization regardless of the Matrigel coating. Wider airway patency was observed in group M than group S. Group M showed migration of epithelium over the scaffold from 4 weeks after transplantation and complete coverage with epithelium at 12 weeks, whereas group S showed migration of the epithelium from 14 weeks and incomplete coverage with epithelium even at 24 weeks. This two-step method, utilizing the platysma as an in vivo bioreactor, may be a promising approach to achieve long-term survival and enhanced luminal patency.

A bioactive RGD-containing peptide from laminin α1 chain, A99 (AGTFALRGDNPQG), promotes strong cell attachment and has demonstrated utility in cell culture and tissue engineering. Various materials can be utilized as a scaffold for bioactive peptides; however, it may be advantageous to design materials that use bioconjugation strategies that do not affect bioactivity, generate homogenous products, and can be produced at scale. This report is the first to compare the methods for preparing chemically conjugated and recombinant A99 to elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) as the scaffold and characterize the biological and cell attachment activity using human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). ELPs are biocompatible protein-polymers that are also thermo-responsive. Below a lower critical solution temperature (LCST), they are highly soluble. Above the LCST, ELPs phase separate into a polymer-rich liquid, known as a coacervate. Both chemically conjugated and recombinant fusion between A99 and an ELP (A99-ELP-R) show dose-dependent cell attachment. In addition, coating above the LCST provides better cell spreading compared to coating at 4°C. ELPs provide an excellent structural framework for deposition of bioactive peptides of the ECM, and their intrinsic biophysical properties make laminin peptide-ELPs promising biomaterials for cell culture and tissue engineering.","",""

However, the poor cell adhesiveness of PDMS limits its application as a stable substrate for long-term cell cultures. To address these challenges, we synthesized a photocrosslinkable terpolymer composed of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)acrylamide, N-benzophenone acrylamide, and N-succinimidyl acrylate (NSA), and covalently grafted it onto PDMS surfaces using UV irradiation. The ternary polymer coatings exhibited long-term stability in aqueous media and suppressed thenonspecific adsorption of proteins and cell adhesion. Furthermore, the immobilization of collagen on the side groups of NSA provides selective cell-adhesive functionality. In particular, PDMS surfaces modified with a ternary polymer containing 10 mol% NSA supported the robust and sustained adhesion of C2C12 myoblasts. When combined with stripe-patterned microstructures, these surfaces promoted unidirectional alignment, efficient myotube formation, and strong expression of dystrophin, with the 25 μm-pitch pattern demonstrating the most pronounced effects. Notably, spontaneous contraction of the formed myotubes confirmed advanced functional differentiation. These results demonstrate that the proposed facile and durable surface modification strategy for PDMS imparts both anti-biofouling properties and selective biofunctionality.

A key challenge in developing these scaffolds is achieving sustained, localized delivery of osteoinductive drugs, which is crucial for enhancing bone tissue regeneration within the defect site. This research engineered a novel κ-carrageenan-based composite scaffold incorporating hydroxyapatite-coated chitosan nanoparticles for regulated rosuvastatin release. Chitosan nanoparticles containing rosuvastatin were synthesized using a water-in-oil emulsion method and subsequently coated with hydroxyapatite. κ-carrageenan-based scaffolds were then fabricated with varying concentrations of nanoparticles (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) and evaluated for their physical and mechanical properties. They were also assessed for biocompatibility, osteogenic differentiation potential, and hemocompatibility. Notably, the hydroxyapatite coating increased the size of nanoparticles and enabled a stable, long-term release of rosuvastatin. Moreover, incorporating these nanoparticles into scaffolds further enhanced the sustained release profile appropriate for long-term bone healing. Scaffolds containing 20% nanoparticles demonstrated the highest mechanical strength and were selected for cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation studies. Alkaline phosphatase activity and alizarin red staining confirmed the scaffolds' ability to promote osteogenic differentiation. Hemocompatibility assessment revealed a low hemolysis percentage (< 5%) for the carrageenan-based scaffolds, indicating good blood compatibility.

Medpor®, a porous high-density polyethylene (HDPE) implant widely used in craniofacial reconstruction, provides excellent mechanical strength but lacks bioactivity, limiting early cell adhesion, vascularization, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. To enhance Medpor® biointegration, we employed a multi-faceted modification strategy combining plasma treatment with biologically active components. Treated implants were coated with collagen and fibrin hydrogels and further supplemented with a platelet-derived Purified Exosome Product (PEP). Modified and control implants were evaluated in a subcutaneous mouse model to assess host tissue response, vascularization, and implant integration. Tissue ingrowth was observed in the pores of all Medpor® implants. Plasma treatment significantly increased the surface hydrophilicity of Medpor®, promoting host cell adhesion and tissue infiltration. Implants modified with both hydrogels and PEP exhibited enhanced ECM deposition, greater vascular density, and improved tissue integration compared to untreated Medpor®. The combination of physicochemical surface treatment and biochemical cues led to a synergistic effect, supporting tissue ingrowth and angiogenesis under a controlled host immune response. This study demonstrates that integrating plasma surface modification with bioactive hydrogels and PEP can effectively enhance the biointegration of Medpor® implants in vivo. The combined approach significantly enhances implant vascularization and ECM development, offering a promising translational strategy for improving synthetic implant performance in regenerative and reconstructive biomaterial applications.","",""

These complications undermine the efficacy of conventional bone repair materials, limiting their capacity to promote effective healing. Herein, we developed a metal-flavonoid functionalized coating strategy that integrates osteogenic and angiogenic metal ions with natural antioxidant flavonoids. Leveraging their chelation ability and strong surface affinity, a one-pot approach is established to endow conventional bone repair materials with tailored biofunctions that modulate the diabetic bone microenvironment and facilitate regeneration. Among the tested candidates, copper-quercetin (CQ) coating is screened as the optimal formulation owing to its potent antioxidative, osteoinductive, and pro-angiogenic properties under high-glucose (HG) conditions. Conventional bone repair materials (e.g., β-tricalcium phosphate, β-TCP) modified with this coating significantly ameliorated oxidative stress, restored osteogenesis, and rescued angiogenesis impaired by persistent hyperglycemia. In diabetic rats, CQ-coated β-TCP (β-TCP@CQ) accelerated bone healing by 1.68-fold compared to unmodified controls. Mechanistically, the CQ coating activated the ATP7A/SOD3/FLT1 axis to restore copper homeostasis in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells while stimulating the PI3K-Akt pathway to enhance osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, the coating exhibited broad versatility across multiple biomaterial compositions (metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites) and structures (2D discs, 3D scaffolds).

This study investigates whether a poly (vinyl alcohol)-stearate (PVA-stearate) surface coating can differentially modulate protein adsorption to direct extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly and cell alignment. The PVA-stearate conjugate was synthesized via esterification and extensively characterized by XRD, DSC, TGA, FTIR, AFM, and XPS, confirming successful chemical integration and a uniform nanoscale topography with moderate roughness compared to uncoated controls. Protein interaction analyses (MALDI-TOF and BCA assays) revealed selective suppression of non-specific globular protein adsorption (albumin, insulin) while facilitating collagen fibrillar assembly. Fibroblast (L929) cultures on the modified surfaces exhibited delayed initial adhesion followed by progressive elongation, unidirectional alignment, and coordinated cytoskeletal organization within 48 h, whereas unmodified substrates supported random orientation and disordered ECM deposition. These findings demonstrate that the PVA-stearate coating functions as a bioinstructive interface, enabling protein-specific modulation and guiding biomimetic cell-ECM interactions.

The experimental study was carried out on 6 rabbits (6 eyes). The original hydrogel biopolymer scaffold of 10.0 mm in diameter, 1.5 and 2.0 mm thick was used as a bio-coating for the cornea. On days 3, 7, and 9 from the beginning of the experiment, the results were histologically tested. On days 3 and 7 of the experiment, histological investigations did not find any structural changes of the anterior segment of the eye and differences between the scaffolds of various thicknesses. The stroma, Descemet's membrane, endothelium, and general topography of the intercellular matrix were not altered. On day 9, structural changes of the anterior segment were not revealed either in the experiment with the 1.5 mm thick scaffold. Histological investigations of the specimen with the 2.0 mm scaffold showed alterations in the form of epithelium thickening, signs of pseudostratified basal layer, hyperplasia of the wing cell layer with the increased number of its layers, greater number of cellular elements in the anterior stroma layers. No structural changes of the Descemet's membrane and corneal endothelium were noted. The suggested hydrogel scaffold-based bio-coating is subject to self-biodegradation without any sequelae to the eye and its adnexa. Increased thickness of the bio-coating results in deceleration of its biodegradation and enhanced activity of proliferative processes in the epithelium and anterior stromal layers, which is indirect evidence of improved regenerative properties of these tissues.","",""

However, creating cell sheets featuring three-dimensional (3D) raised textures that mimic the complex architecture of natural tissues continues to present a considerable challenge. This study introduces a versatile methodology for fabricating cell sheets with both 2D patterns and 3D microstructures, utilizing picosecond laser-induced microgroove-patterned polystyrene (PS) culture dishes. This technology leverages the sequential interaction of the laser with the photosensitive coating and the PS substrate to create microgrooves with exceptional precision in both width and depth. Both direct ablation and coating-assisted ablation result in patterned culture dishes that demonstrate excellent cell compatibility, an absence of cytotoxicity, and the ability to regulate cell proliferation. The patterned PS dishes create distinct 3D microenvironments that guide cell contact and adhesion arrangements, thereby modulating gene expression and protein secretion in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). Notably, key proteins such as type I alpha1 collagen (Col-1), type VI alpha1 collagen (Col-6), Elastin (ELN), fibronectin (FN), and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) are significantly influenced by the structure of pattern. Furthermore, cell sheets with raised textures (CSRT) can be detached from the patterned PS culture dishes while preserving their 3D structure for over 72 hours, with structural longevity dependent on feature size. To our knowledge, this study represents the first successful fabrication of CSRT using a laser-induced micro-patterning technique.

Here, a series of organic-inorganic composites containing well-defined proxies for biogenic calcium phosphate particles at successive stages of bone biomineralization reveals that osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells increases significantly for partially crystalline hydroxyapatite nanoparticles coated with a hydrophilic amorphous surface layer whose proportion reaches at least 35 %. This coating occurs naturally on bone hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, with a proportion that decreases as the particles age, and may contribute to the unparalleled clinical success of autologous bone grafts. Mechanistically, a hydration shell of tightly bound water molecules on the amorphous layer is proposed to enhance binding of extracellular signaling molecules at the cell-material interface, amplifying osteogenic commitment.

Thiolated glutaraldehyde cross-linked pericardium was prepared by multicomponent co-cross-linking, followed by the construction of a glycocalyx-like coating via Michael addition and radical polymerization, and subsequently loaded with anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant drugs (rosmarinic acid and heparin) to obtain RA/Hep-GAP.

The nanozyme, composed of polyphenol-coordinated iridium (Ir)/ruthenium (Ru), exhibited tunable superoxide dismutase (SOD)- and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-like activities by adjusting the Ir/Ru ratio. The scaffold was further modified with a sulfonated polymer via in situ radical polymerization, forming an anticoagulant and pro-endothelial cell (EC) adhesion interface. In the diabetic microenvironment, the scaffold first mimicked SOD activity to convert •O2- into H2O2 and subsequently exhibited eNOS-like activity to catalyze the reaction between H2O2 and endogenous arginine for NO generation, ultimately inhibiting EC apoptosis and promoting EC proliferation and migration. Additionally, the nanozyme coating effectively scavenged hyperglycemia-induced •O2- overproduction in macrophages, mitigating inflammatory responses.

The current gold standard for grafting uses autologous tissue; however, this approach carries limitations such as donor site morbidity. Consequently, there is a growing interest in alternative biomaterials. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), a thermoplastic with bone-like mechanical properties, has shown promise, although its limited bioactivity remains a critical constraint. Various functionalization strategies have been employed to enhance the biological performance of otherwise inert materials. This study aims to develop a functionalized porous PEEK scaffold to improve bioactivity of the material, thereby promoting human osteoblast (HOB) adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. PEEK scaffolds were fabricated using fused deposition modeling (FDM) (Apium P155), with a rectilinear pattern alternating at +45° and -45° angles between layers. This configuration generated an interconnected pore network with sizes ranging from ∼100 to 400 μm. The scaffolds were further coated with titanium oxide as an additional intervention to enhance bioactivity. Mechanical properties of both porous and solid constructs were evaluated according to ISO 178, a flexural testing standard for plastics. Results indicated that both porous scaffolds exhibited a 10-fold decrease in flexural modulus and were 10 times more flexible compared to the solid counterpart (p < 0.001). The mechanical properties of both porous scaffolds were consistent with values reported for trabecular bone, while the solid construct demonstrated a flexural modulus comparable to cortical bone. These findings suggest that the porous PEEK scaffold, both neat and titanium oxide-coated, possesses mechanical properties similar to bone in vivo, indicating its potential as a mechanically suitable biomaterial for bone grafting applications.","",""

The aim of this study was to analyze the suitability of LCM and ACM alone or coated with heparin (the latter are abbreviated as LCMH and ACMH, respectively) as implant material for cartilage repair. Therefore, mesenchymal stem cells were chondrogenically differentiated in 2D cultures with polymer discs. Differentiation was induced by the supplementation of cell medium with dimethyloxalylglycine, TGF-β, and BMP2. After 5 days, no increase in proinflammatory factors was observed. Cell viability declined on ACM and ACMH discs. During early chondrogenesis, SOX9 expression increased on LCM and LCMH discs, while TRPV4 expression decreased on ACMH discs. At day 20, the level of collagen type II increased on LCM, LCMH, and ACM discs, demonstrating the ability of chondrogenic development on these implants. In summary, coating with heparin showed no advantages compared to pure LCM and ACM. For cartilage repair, LCM is more suitable than ACM in this 2D in vitro model, which needs to be verified by long-term 3D models and in vivo studies.","",""

For the cartilage phase, SF scaffolds were coated with gelatin and/or agarose layers. For bone scaffolds, mineralized collagen solutions were coated on or mixed into the SF matrix. The physical and biological properties of these samples were evaluated to find the optimum conditions for a biphasic scaffold. Modification of both cartilage and bone scaffolds resulted in a smaller pore size, lower swelling rate, and higher rigidity. Gelatin significantly promoted cartilage biomarker production and agarose facilitated cell proliferation, inducing a homogeneous cell distribution and stimulating chondrogenesis.

Surfactant coatings are critical in four major biomedical areas: preventing biofilm formation on implants with antimicrobial agents (e.g., silver-surfactant composites, quaternary ammonium surfactants); improving biocompatibility and hemocompatibility in devices such as cardiovascular stents; controlled drug delivery by micelle-based delivery systems; and smart, stimulus-responsive surfaces that respond to pH or temperature changes. Although surfactant-assisted coatings demonstrate significant potential in improving biomaterial properties, challenges such as stability, cytotoxicity, and scalability hinder their widespread adoption.

To address this, we have developed an innovative coating material that mimics the piezoelectric characteristics of natural bone with a d33 coefficient of 7.8 pm/V. The material was fabricated by replacing titanium (Ti) in the BaTiO3 crystal lattice with copper (Cu), a strategy that not only augments the piezoelectric response but also harnesses the osteogenic potential of Cu. BaCuxTi1-xO3 reveals an enhanced piezoelectric performance and actively promotes the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, doped Cu modulates osteogenic differentiation through the upregulation of the Wnt4/β-catenin/SP7/Osterix signaling pathway. The synergistical effect caused by piezoelectricity and the biological activity of Cu contributed to promoting bone regeneration in vivo; in particular, H-BaCuxTi1-xO3 led to a 15.6% increase of the bone volume percentage compared to BaTiO3. Furthermore, H-BaCuxTi1-xO3 promoted the accumulation of bone extracellular matrix components including Osteopontin (OPN) and Collagen Type I (COL-1), which, respectively, increased by 62.12 and 155%.

Despite extensive preclinical research, the challenge of integrating newly formed bone and cartilage has hindered clinical adoption, driving the continuous development of more effective constructs. To address this issue, we propose an approach centred on a protein-modified stratified multi-phasic scaffolds. In this investigation, we developed a bottom layer composed of polydopamine-modified 3D printed poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds loaded with simvastatin, complemented by an upper layer consisting of electrospun PLGA-gelatine fibres obtained by a green strategy, e.g., using a benign solvent. Scaffolds were then coated with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)- bovine serum albumin (BSA). The multi-phasic scaffolds exhibited a hierarchical interconnected porous microstructure with hydrophilicity characterized by a contact angle of 24° and a swelling rate of 467 % over 24 h (n = 5), contributing to in-vitro hydrolytic degradation under controllable degradation rates of 49 % over 4 weeks (n = 5). Scaffolds were also shown to undergo hydroxyapatite mineralization.

The development of nanostructured surfaces of polymeric nanocomposites has garnered increasing attention in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their ability to modulate cellular responses and enhance tissue regeneration. Various top-down and bottom-up techniques, including nanolithography, etching, deposition, laser ablation, template-assisted synthesis, and nanografting techniques, are employed to create structured surfaces on biomaterials. Additionally, nanotopographies can be fabricated using polymeric nanocomposites, with or without the integration of organic and inorganic nanomaterials, through advanced methods such as using electrospinning, layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly, sol-gel processing, in situ polymerization, 3D printing, template-assisted methods, and spin coating. The surface topography of polymeric nanocomposite scaffolds can be tailored through the incorporation of organic nanomaterials (e.g., chitosan, dextran, alginate, collagen, polydopamine, cellulose, polypyrrole) and inorganic nanomaterials (e.g., silver, gold, titania, silica, zirconia, iron oxide). The choice of fabrication technique depends on the desired surface features, material properties, and specific biomedical applications. Nanotopographical modifications on biomaterials' surface play a crucial role in regulating cell behavior, including adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and migration, which are critical for tissue engineering and repair. For effective tissue regeneration, it is imperative that scaffolds closely mimic the native extracellular matrix (ECM), providing a mechanical framework and topographical cues that replicate matrix elasticity and nanoscale surface features. This ECM biomimicry is vital for responding to biochemical signaling cues, orchestrating cellular functions, metabolic processes, and subsequent tissue organization. The integration of nanotopography within scaffold matrices has emerged as a pivotal regulator in the development of next-generation biomaterials designed to regulate cellular responses for enhanced tissue repair and organization. Additionally, these scaffolds with specific surface topographies, such as grooves (linear channels that guide cell alignment), pillars (protrusions), holes/pits/dots (depressions), fibrous structures (mimicking ECM fibers), and tubular arrays (array of tubular structures), are crucial for regulating cell behavior and promoting tissue repair. This review presents recent advances in the fabrication methodologies used to engineer nanotopographical microenvironments in polymeric nanocomposite tissue scaffolds through the incorporation of nanomaterials and biomolecular functionalization.

The AM 316 L SS are subjected to metallurgical, mechanical, chemical, in vitro and in vivo analyses for their possible orthopedic applications. Compared to commercially available 316 L SS implant, the AM implants encompass γ-austenite phases with δ-ferrite structures that induce pinning dislocations, improve resistance to crack propagation and enhance mechanical performances.

Tissue engineering seeks to improve repair using synthetic polymer scaffolds with biomimetic factors to enhance the regenerative potential. Methods: In this study, we compared three groups, namely, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) meltblown scaffolds, PLA meltblown scaffolds coated with tendon-derived matrix (TDM), and PLA meltblown scaffolds with carbodiimide crosslinked TDM (2.5:1:1 EDC:NHS:COOH ratio) (EDC-TDM) and determined their potential for engineered tendon development. We cultured human adipose stem cells (hASCs) for 28 days on meltblown scaffolds (n = 4-6/group) and measured tensile mechanical function, matrix synthesis, and matrix composition using biochemical assays and proteomics. Results: Coating PLA meltblown scaffolds with TDM improved yield stretch and stress at 28 days compared with PLA. Matrix synthesis rates for TDM or EDC-TDM were similar to PLA. Proteomic analysis revealed that hASCs produced a collagen-rich extracellular matrix, with many tendon-related matrix proteins. Coating scaffolds with TDM led to an increase in collagen type I whereas EDC-TDM scaffolds had an increase in glycoproteins and ECM regulators compared with other groups, consistent with increased maturity of the newly deposited matrix. Conclusions: TDM coating and crosslinking of meltblown scaffolds demonstrated matricellular benefits for the proteome of engineered tendon development but provided fewer clear benefits toward mechanical, biochemical, and rate of matrix accumulation than expected, and that previous work with electrospun scaffolds would suggest. However, electrospun scaffolds have different fiber structure and microarchitecture than meltblown, suggesting that further consideration of these differences and refinement of TDM application methods to meltblown scaffolds is required.","",""

With the capability of responding to an acute inflammation microenvironment followed by a triggered on-demand release of the IL-4, the combination of immunoactive IL-4 and Mg2+ co-ordinately facilitated metabolic reprogramming by suppressing glycolysis, promoting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and modulating adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathways in macrophages, resulting in significantly facilitating M2 macrophage activation. During the stage of tissue remodelling, the sustained release of Mg2+ further promoted macrophage M2 polarization and the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, significantly reduced immune response and improved ectopic osteogenesis ability. Meanwhile, the cranial defect models of male rats demonstrated that this scaffold could significantly enhance biomineralized deposition and vascularisation, and achieve good bone regeneration of cranial defects.

Coating substrates plays a critical role in AFE generation. Currently, conventional large molecule proteins like Matrigel are used in most differentiation protocols. However, the complex components and mechanisms of these coatings have limited both the exploration of cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction and potential clinical applications. In this study, we identified eight pure synthetic integrin-binding short peptides as effective coatings for iPSC growth and AFE generation with an integrin-binding peptide array. Our results showed that integrinα5β1-,αVβ8-, andαIIbβ3-binding peptides supported the adhesion and expansion of iPSCs and AFE generation by guided differentiation via a definitive endoderm (DE) in a full-anchorage-dependent manner. AFE generation was also found on coatings based on integrinα3β1-,α6β1-,αVβ1-,αVβ6-, andαMβ2-binding peptides following a process with temporal suspension growth in the DE-inducing stage, with lower AFE generation efficiency compared to the full-anchorage-dependent peptide groups and Matrigel. According to the results, the integrinα5β1-binding peptide is the most promising defined substrate for inducing AFEs because of its equivalent efficiency with traditional Matrigel coating in supporting iPSC expansion and differentiation toward AFEs. Additionally, the other seven peptide-based coatings also exhibit potential and could be further investigated for developing synthetic-coating strategies in future studies involving AFEs. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of integrin and ECM function and hold great potential for disease modeling as well as therapeutic exploration of AFE origin organs.","",""

This study aims to address these challenges by investigating bacterial cellulose (BC) as a promising material for CCS. Variability in patch quality from previous studies was addressed by refining the production protocol taking advantage of optical density (OD) measurements. After a 72 h incubation, patches were harvested and tested mechanically with burst pressure and uniaxial strain testing. BC's biomechanical properties were further explored by modifying nutrient concentrations, creating different media groups (N10, N30, N50). Hybrid patches combining BC with electrospun polyurethane (ESP-PU) were developed using a specially designed 3D-printed flask to ensure uniform coating and integration. The initial bacterial concentration significantly influenced cellulose yield and growth rate, with static cultures outperforming shaken ones. Nutrient-enriched media (N10, N30, N50) produced cellulose with greater elasticity and strength compared to standard C-Medium, with stiffness correlating to nutrient concentration. Inflation tests showed that N10 and N30 samples withstood higher pressures than N50, which, despite being stiffer, performed worse under rapid inflation. All samples, however, maintained pressures above physiological levels. Scanning electron microscopy analysis confirmed effective BC coating of PU fibres without altering BC fibre orientation or bacterial activity. BC patches demonstrated burst pressure resistance above 1,400 mmHg. BC's elasticity can be tailored, and in combination with ESP-PU, an innovative hybrid material can be produced, positioning BC as a promising biomaterial for future CCS implant development.","",""

The objective of this work was to develop and implement a finite element (FE) model that utilizes a damage evolution law for pitting corrosion to predict the degradation of pure Mg (non-coated) and HA-coated pure Mg (coated) materials simulated in physiological conditions. Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed on a cylindrical Mg specimen (25.4 mm diameter, 8 mm height) through Abaqus/Standard software to incrementally monitor the damage value of each Mg element and subsequently delete fully-degraded elements from the simulation. A Fortran user-material (UMAT) subroutine assigned each element a pitting parameter, controlling the rate of degradation throughout the simulation and providing necessary inputs of elastic material properties and degradation model parameters for pure Mg and HA into Abaqus. The simulations allowed for the visualization of both pure Mg and HA-coated pure Mg degradation over a 120-day period, displaying expected degradation trends such as lower corrosion rates for HA-coated Mg and degradation propagating from the edges inward. Simulation results were calibrated with our prior results from a 30-day experimental degradation study via direct comparison with mass loss over time. Additionally, lower length scale, density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed to provide physical meaning for the model pitting parameter. The FE simulation was extended to model resin-enclosed pure Mg and HA-coated pure Mg degradation, where only the top surface of the specimen was exposed to the corrosion surface, for investigating changes in Mg surface roughness (height) over time. The impacts of this work include the establishment of a computational model of pure Mg and HA-coated pure Mg degradation calibrated using in vitro degradation data to advance the use of Mg-based biomaterials, and more broadly, to predict degradation rates of next-generation orthopedic implants.","",""

Titanium disks were prepared with a sandblasted, large grit and acid-etched (SLA) surface. EPD was employed to deposit collagen type I onto the titanium surfaces, followed by two modes of mineralization: extra-fibril mineralization (EFM) and inter-fibril mineralization (IFM). Then comprehensive in vitro studies were conducted including surface properties, cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and inflammatory responses. EPD successfully deposited a uniform collagen layer on titanium surfaces. EFM resulted in deposition of larger, irregularly shaped crystals, while IFM produced controlled, helical fibril mineralization. IFM-treated surfaces exhibited enhanced cell viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. Both EFM and IFM surfaces triggered higher macrophage activation than SLA surfaces. While EFM primarily induced a stronger M1 pro-inflammatory response, IFM exhibited a more balanced macrophage polarization with upregulated M2 markers at later stages. EPD, particularly when integrated with IFM, significantly enhances the bioactivity and osteogenic potential of collagen-coated titanium implants. This method surpasses traditional SLA surfaces by stabilizing the collagen layer and creating a biomimetic environment conducive to bone regeneration and healing through a balanced inflammatory response, offering a promising strategy to improve titanium implant performance.","",""

The method primarily relies on electrostatic attraction and entails the consecutive deposition of electrolyte complexes with opposite charges onto a substrate, leading to the formation of homogeneous single layers that can be quickly deposited to produce nanolayer films. LbL has attracted considerable interest as a coating technology because of its ease of production, cost-effectiveness, and capability to apply diverse biomaterial coatings without compromising the primary bio-functional properties of the substrate materials.

Guided tissue regeneration (GTR) using barrier membranes for alveolar bone repair is a common clinical treatment. However, most commercially available collagen barrier membranes are expensive and lack the antibacterial properties essential for effective bone regeneration. Herein, we report a natural polysaccharide chitin hydrogel barrier membrane with a Janus structure (ChT-PDA-p-HAP), featuring high antibacterial and protein-repelling activity on the outer side and good osteogenesis ability on the inner side. This multifunctional membrane is fabricated though a three-step process: (i) dissolution and regeneration of chitin, (ii) co-deposition with polydopamine (PDA) and poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (pSBMA), and (iii) coating with gelatin-hydroxyapatite (gelatin-HAP). In vitro cell experiments demonstrated the membrane's high biocompatibility and significant osteogenic activity. In vivo implantation in rats with periodontal defects revealed that the cemento-enamel junction index of the ChT-PDA-p-HAP membrane (1.165 mm) was superior to that of the commercial Bio-Gide® membrane (1.350 mm). This work presents a method for fabricating a chitin-based Janus barrier membrane, potentially expanding the use of chitin in tissue engineering.

Direct measurement of these microenvironmental forces has been challenging, particularly for cell-dense models. To address this, we previously developed hydrogel-based force sensors that are approximately the size of a cell and can be imaged over time to computationally assess the forces exerted by surrounding cells and matrix. The goal of this project was to identify how the physical characteristics of force sensors impact measurements. Sensors were varied in size, elastic modulus, and surface coating before being included in stem cell suspensions that then spontaneously self-assembled into spheroidal neotissues. Using this model of early mesenchymal condensation, we hypothesized that larger, softer sensors would provide greater sensitivity and precision, whereas protein coatings would influence the directionality of applied forces (tensile vs. compressive). These experiments were conducted using a high-content imaging system that allowed analysis of over a thousand sensors to evaluate the various conditions. Results indicated that measurement fidelity was highest for force sensors that had a diameter >20 µm and modulus ∼0.2 kPa. Extremely soft sensors deformed too much, whereas stiffer sensors deformed too little. Collagen and N-cadherin coatings, which replicated cell-matrix or cell-cell binding, respectively, allowed for tensile forces to be exerted on the sensors, with greater forces being observed for N-cadherin sensors in these highly cellular neotissue constructs. Uncoated sensors were universally compressed due to the lack of cell-sensor adhesion. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton lessened microenvironmental forces, whereas disruption of microtubules had no measurable effect. Potential future applications of the technology include studies of in situ forces in developing tissues as well as a real-time sensor for monitoring the growth of engineered constructs.","",""

Traditional animal models, while useful, do not fully capture the intricacies of human kidney physiology and pathophysiology. Tissue engineering offers a promising solution, yet current models often fall short in replicating the complex microarchitecture and biochemical milieu of the kidney. To address this challenge, we propose the development of a sophisticated in vitro glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) utilizing advanced biomaterials and a kidney decellularized extracellular matrix (kdECM). In our approach, we employ a bacterial cellulose membrane (BC) as a scaffold, providing a robust framework for cell growth and interaction. Coating this scaffold with kdECM hydrogel derived from caprine kidney tissue via a detergent-free decellularization method ensures the preservation of vital extracellular matrix proteins crucial for cellular compatibility and signaling. Our engineered GFB not only supports the growth of endothelial and podocyte cells but also exhibits the presence of key markers such as CD31 and nephrin, indicating successful cellular integration. Furthermore, the expression of collagen IV, an essential extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, validates the fidelity of our model in simulating cellular interactions within a kdECM matrix. Additionally, we assessed the filtration efficiency of the developed GFB model using albumin, a standard protein, to evaluate its performance under conditions that closely mimic the native physiological environment. This innovative approach, which faithfully recapitulates the native microenvironment of the glomerulus, holds immense promise for elucidating kidney disease mechanisms, conducting permeability studies, and advancing personalized therapeutic strategies.

Some studies indicate that a porcine bone graft demonstrates excellent biocompatibility and holds promise as a xenograft for GBR. However, only a few studies have investigated the effectiveness of this biomaterial after magnesium coating in improving osteoblast performance. Aim: This study aimed to prove that the hydrothermal method can be used to coat magnesium oxide (MgO) on the surface of a porcine graft and enhance the biomaterial's property for better osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts in vitro. Materials and Method: A porcine bone graft was produced, and the hydrothermal method was used to coat 2 mM and 5 mM of MgO on the graft. Material physiochemistry and biocompatibility analyses were performed at days 1, 3, and 5. Results: pH value assay results suggested that MgO slightly increased the alkalinity of the graft. SEM images showed that MgO with some surface roughness was coated on the porcine bone surface, and EDX indicated that the Mg and O element percentages increased by about 5% and 9%, respectively. The porcine graft coated with MgO was rougher than an uncoated porcine graft. FTIR analysis of the porcine graft implied that its chemical structure did not change due to MgO hydrothermal processing. Cell viability assay illustrated the highest cell proliferation with the porcine graft with 5 mM MgO (P < 0.001), and good cell attachment was observed on the graft with immunofluorescence using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cell differentiation assay results revealed that the porcine graft with 5 mM MgO had the highest alkaline phosphate activity (P < 0.0001) among the uncoated porcine graft and the porcine graft with 2 mM MgO. Relative quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) at days 1 and 5 revealed upregulated osteoblast gene expression with a statistically significant difference.

Thus, the findings of this study indicate that a porcine graft with 5 mM MgO has great potential as a bio-bone graft for guided bone regeneration.","",""

Calcium phosphate, alone or in combination with other materials in natural bone, has been shown to aid in bone regeneration effectively. Monetite exhibits superior solubility and resorption rates among calcium phosphates, rendering it an optimal choice for bone regeneration applications. However, the degradation rate of the Monetite is much faster than that of all the other calcium phosphates. Hence, we have added Europium onto the matrix to alter the degradation profile and enhance the osteogenic ability of the prepared matrix. Materials and methods An exclusive Europium-Monetite composite was synthesized employing eco-friendly techniques involving Cissus quadrangularis. The osteogenic potential was gauged using the MG-63 cell line through a calcium mineralization assay employing an Alizarin Red solution, collagen estimation, and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay. The composite's cytocompatibility was evaluated using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay across different concentrations ranging from 12.5 µg to 100 µg. Results Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the Europium-Monetite composite revealed a sheet-like arrangement in stacks, and the ATR-IR confirmed the presence of elements Ca, P, and Eu. The osteogenic potential, analyzed by ALP activity, calcium mineralization, and collagen staining, was 10% higher than that of the control (Monetite).  Conclusion The prepared novel Europium-Monetite calcium phosphate complex can enhance the osteogenic potential and could be a promising material for bone regeneration/tissue engineering. The newly created Europium-Monetite calcium phosphate complex holds promise for various bone grafting applications, including integration into scaffolds and as a coating for implants.","",""

First, a patient-specific one-body scaffold implant used for reconstructing a critical-sized defect along the lower border of the sheep mandible ramus was designed using on computed-tomographic (CT) imagery and computer-aided design software. Next, the biomechanical performance of the implant was predicted numerically by simulating physiological load conditions in a digital twin in silico finite element model of the sheep mandible. This allowed for possible redesigning of the implant prior to commencing in vivo experimentation. Then, two types of polymeric biomaterials were used to manufacture the mandibular scaffold implants: poly ether ether ketone (PEEK) and poly ether ketone (PEK) printed with fused deposition modeling (FDM) and selective laser sintering (SLS), respectively. Then, after being implanted for 13 weeks in vivo, the implant and surrounding bone tissue was harvested and microCT scanned to visualize and quantify neo-tissue formation in the porous space of the scaffold. Finally, the implant and local bone tissue was assessed by in vitro laboratory mechanical testing to quantify the osteointegration.

Tissue engineering utilizes scaffolds for cell adhesion and differentiation. Although synthetic scaffolds offer initial strength, their long-term stability is surpassed by biological scaffolds. Combining polycaprolactone (PCL) toughness with collagen in scaffold design, this study refines fabrication via electrospinning, aiming to deliver enduring biomimetic matrices for widespread applications in musculoskeletal repair. Methods Electrospinning employed four solutions with varied collagen and PCL concentrations, dissolved in chloroform, methanol, and hexafluoro-2-propanol. Solutions were combined to yield 60 mg/mL concentrations with different collagen/PCL ratios. Electrospinning at 12-14kV voltage produced scaffolds, followed by vacuum-drying. Collagen coating was applied to PCL and 15% collagen/PCL scaffolds using a 0.1% collagen solution. SEM characterized fiber morphology, tensile testing was conducted to determine the mechanical properties of the scaffold, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyzed scaffold composition. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyzed the stiffness properties of individual fibers, and a finite element model was developed to predict the mechanical properties. Cell culture involved seeding human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells onto scaffolds, which were assessed through Alamar Blue assay and confocal imaging. Results Various scaffolds (100% PCL, PCL-15% collagen, PCL-25% collagen, PCL-35% collagen) were fabricated to emulate the extracellular matrix, revealing collagen's impact on fiber diameter reduction with increasing concentration. Tensile testing highlighted collagen's initial enhancement of mechanical strength, followed by a decline beyond PCL-15% collagen. FTIR spectroscopy detected potential hydrogen bonding between collagen and PCL. A finite element model predicted scaffold response to external forces which was validated by the tensile test data. Cell viability and proliferation assays demonstrated successful plating on all scaffolds, with optimal proliferation observed in PCL-25% collagen. Confocal imaging confirmed stem cell integration into the three-dimensional material. Collagen coating preserved nanofiber morphology, with no significant changes in diameter. Coating of collagen significantly altered the tensile strength of the scaffolds at the macro scale. AFM highlighted stiffness differences between PCL and collagen-coated PCL mats at the single fiber scale. The coating process did not significantly enhance initial cell attachment but promoted increased proliferation on collagen-coated PCL scaffolds. Conclusion The study reveals collagen-induced mechanical and morphological alterations, influencing fiber alignment, diameter, and chemical composition while emphasizing scaffolds' vital role in providing a controlled niche for stem cell proliferation and differentiation. The optimization of each of these scaffold characteristics and subsequent finite element modeling can lead to highly repeatable and ideal scaffold properties for stem cell integration and proliferation.","",""

Specifically, we utilized mouse myoblasts (C2C12), and our results demonstrate that we achieved excellent cell alignment in conjunction with the development of a cytocompatible surface. Consequently, the outcomes of this research contribute to an enhanced comprehension of surface properties and interactions between structured polymers and mammalian cells. The use of periodic microstructures has the potential to advance the creation of novel materials and scaffolds in tissue engineering. These materials exhibit exceptional biocompatibility and possess the capacity to promote cell adhesion and growth.","",""

In the present study, coating layers consisting of fluoride-incorporated apatite (FAp) crystals with immobilized bFGF were coated on a porous collagen sponge by a precursor-assisted biomimetic process using supersaturated calcium phosphate solutions with various fluoride concentrations. The fluoride content in the coating layer increased with the increasing fluoride concentration of the supersaturated solution.

Decellularized materials have garnered considerable attention due to their elevated biocompatibility, reduced immunogenicity, excellent biodegradability, and the ability to partially mimic the in vivo microenvironment conducive to cell growth. To address the issue of mesenchymal stem cells losing their stem cell characteristics during two-dimensional (2D) cultivation, this study established three-dimensional cell carriers modified with lung decellularized extracellular matrix and assessed its impact on the life activities of mesenchymal stem cells. Methods: This study employed PET as a substrate material, grafting with polydopamine (PDA), and constructing a decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) coating on its surface, thus creating the PET/PDA/dECM three-dimensional (3D) composite carrier. Subsequently, material characterization of the cellular carriers was conducted, followed by co-culturing with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, aiming to investigate the material's impact on the proliferation and paracrine activity of mesenchymal stem cells. Results and Discussion: Material characterization demonstrated successful grafting of PDA and dECM materials, and it had complete hydrophilicity, high porosity, and excellent mechanical properties. The material was rich in various ECM proteins (collagen I, collagen IV , laminin, fibronectin, elastin), indicating good biocompatibility. In long-term in vitro cultivation (14 days) experiments, the PET/PDA/dECM three-dimensional composite carrier significantly enhanced adhesion and proliferation of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HUCMSCs), with a proliferation rate 1.9 times higher than that of cells cultured on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) at day 14. Furthermore, it effectively maintained the stem cell characteristics, expressing specific antigens for HUCMSCs. Through qPCR, Western blot, and ELISA experiments, the composite carrier markedly promoted the expression and secretion of key cell factors in HUCMSCs. These results demonstrate that the PET/PDA/dECM composite carrier holds great potential for scaling up MSCs' long-term in vitro cultivation and the production of paracrine factors.","",""

However, a significant challenge persists in creating large-scale tissue structures with a 3D geometrical architecture using spheroids, due to the continual condensation and reorganization of cells and their environments. Methods: The spherical cell aggregates (pseudo-cell spheroids) or macroscale cell aggregates were obtained by coating each adipose-derived stem cell (hASC) with methacrylated collagen (Col-Ma). Subsequently, the coated cells were printed into an alginate supporting bath and photocrosslinked through exposure to UV light. To assess the effectiveness of this procedure on regenerative potential, the generated cell aggregates were compared with conventional cell spheroids and bioprinted cell constructs using immunofluorescent staining and quantification of myogenic-related gene expressions. Moreover, the bioconstructs were implanted into a mouse model with volumetric muscle loss to further elucidate their regenerative and functional recovery properties. Results: The use of Col-Ma as a cell-coating material enables the rapid and physical aggregation of cells within several hours, regardless of the cell type. Furthermore, Col-Ma-coated cell aggregates can provide relatively lower hypoxic conditions than cell spheroids fabricated using the hanging drop method owing to the thin porous Col-Ma layer coated on the cells. In addition, the resulting structures maintain their geometrical architecture following cell fusion and possess the potential for efficient scale-up and 3D complex shape formation, making them more suitable for clinical applications than conventional cell spheroids. Finally, the feasibility of the Col-Ma-coated cylindrical human adipose-derived stem cells aggregates was assessed through implantation in a mouse volumetric muscle loss model, showing a significantly higher regenerative ability of muscle tissue than the normally bioprinted cell construct. Conclusion: Our newly proposed method has meaningful potential for various tissue engineering applications, supported by the improved cellular activities and efficient muscle regeneration observed in both in vitro and in vivo studies, and organ-chip models.","",""

The successful synthesis of PDA/GO on collagen membranes was verified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The wettability of PDA/GO-modified collagen membranes was considerably improved based on the characterization by water contact angle compared to the uncoated membranes and surface coatings solely by either PDA or GO.

As a result, the 3D bone and vascular geometry of the native bone cortical and cancellous compartments was reproduced, and the rat tail collagen-PLLA biomaterial could in vitro act as a surrogate of the perivascular extracellular matrix (ECM) around the wall of the biomaterial-reconstituted cancellous vessels.

However, there are still no reports or findings on in vitro controlling the dedifferentiation. Although ceiling culture performed in related studies is a relatively simple method, its yield is low and does not allow manipulation of mature adipocytes to increase or decrease the dedifferentiation. In this study, to understand the role of physicochemical surface effects on the dedifferentiation of patient-derived mature adipocytes, the surfaces of cell culture flasks were coated with extracellular matrix, basement membrane proteins, and cationic/anionic polymers. Extracellular matrix such as fibronectin and collagen type I, and basement membrane proteins such as collagen type IV and laminin strongly promoted dedifferentiation of mature adipocytes, with laminin showing the highest effect with a DFAT ratio of 2.98 (±0.84).

JPC adhesion/proliferation, gene and protein expression by immunofluorescent staining of embedded scaffolds were analyzed. Raman spectroscopy measurements gave an insight into material properties and cell mineralization. PDL-coated β-TCP scaffolds showed a significantly higher flexural strength in comparison to that of uncoated scaffolds. Degradation kinetics showed considerable differences in pH and electrical conductivity of the three different polymer types, while the core material β-TCP was able to stabilize pH and conductivity. Material differences seemed to have an impact on JPC proliferation and differentiation potential, as reflected by the expression of osteogenic marker genes.

Most interesting from a bone engineer's point of view, the PDL-04 coating enabled detection of cell matrix mineralization by Raman spectroscopy.

To address this issue, we explored the use of an ECM-based hydrogel coating to serve as an adhesive tool, as demonstrated in vascular tissue engineering. The efficacy of cells to supplement mechanical strength in the coating was explored. Specifically, selected coatings were applied to an engineered artery tunica adventitia to accurately test their properties in a natural tissue support structure. Multiple iterations of three primary hydrogels with and without cells were tested: fibrin, collagen, and gelatin hydrogels with and without fibroblasts. The effectiveness of a natural crosslinker to further stabilize and strengthen the hydrogels was investigated, namely genipin extracted from the gardenia fruit. We found that gelatin crosslinked with genipin alone exhibited the highest tensile strength; however, fibrin gel supported cell viability the most. Overall, fibrin gel coating without genipin was deemed optimal for its balance in increasing mechanical strength while still supporting cell viability and was used in the final mechanical and hydrodynamic testing assessments.

Retention of biomimetic factors on the scaffolds is likely critical to maximize their benefit, while minimizing the risk of adverse effects, and without losing the beneficial effects of the biomimetic factors. The aim of the current study was to evaluate cross-linking methods to enhance the retention of tendon-derived matrix (TDM) on electrospun poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds. We tested the effects of ultraviolet (UV) or carbodiimide (EDC:NHS:COOH) crosslinking methods to better retain TDM to the scaffolds and stimulate tendon-like matrix synthesis. Initially, we tested various crosslinking configurations of carbodiimide (2.5:1:1, 5:2:1, and 10:4:1 EDC:NHS:COOH ratios) and UV (30 s 1 J/cm2 , 60 s 1 J/cm2 , and 60 s 4 J/cm2 ) on PCL films compared to un-crosslinked TDM. We found that no crosslinking tested retained more TDM than coating alone (Kruskal-Wallis: p > .05), but that human adipose stem cells (hASCs) spread most on the 60 s 1 J/cm2 UV- and 2.5:1:1 EDC-crosslinked films (Kruskal-Wallis: p < .05). Next, we compared the effects of 60 s 1 J/cm2 UV- and 2.5:1:1 EDC-crosslinked to TDM-coated and untreated PCL scaffolds on hASC-induced tendon-like differentiation. UV-crosslinked scaffolds had greater modulus and stiffness than PCL or TDM scaffolds, and hASCs spread more on UV-crosslinked scaffolds (ANOVA: p < .05). Fourier transform infrared spectra revealed that UV- or EDC-crosslinking TDM did not affect the peaks at wavenumbers characteristic of tendon. Crosslinking TDM to electrospun scaffolds improves tendon-like matrix synthesis, providing a viable strategy for improving retention of TDM on electrospun PCL scaffolds.","",""

Reconstructing the osteoconductive bone microenvironment into a scaffold can attract native mesenchymal stem cells and differentiate them into osteoblasts at the defect site. The symbiotic relationship between cell biology and biomaterial engineering could result in composite polymers containing the necessary signals to recreate tissue- and organ-specific differentiation. In the current work, drawing inspiration from the natural stem cell niche to govern stem cell fate, the cell-instructive hydrogel platforms were constructed by engineering the mineralized microenvironment. This work employed two different hydroxyapatite delivery strategies to create a mineralized microenvironment in an alginate-PEGDA interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogel. The first approach involved coating of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp) on poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres and then encapsulating the coated microspheres in an IPN hydrogel for a sustained release of nHAp, whereas the second approach involved directly loading nHAp into the IPN hydrogel. This study demonstrate that both direct encapsulation and a sustained release approach showed enhanced osteogenesis in target-encapsulated cells; however, direct loading of nHAp into the IPN hydrogel increased the mechanical strength and swelling ratio of the scaffold by 4.6-fold and 1.14-fold, respectively. In addition, the biochemical and molecular studies revealed improved osteoinductive and osteoconductive potential of encapsulated target cells. Being less expensive and simple to perform, this approach could be beneficial in clinical settings.","",""

On the contrary, there is an increasing need to develop flexible biohybrid robotic devices capable of maintaining their functionality beyond laboratory settings. In this study, we describe a stretchable and perfusable device to sustain cell culture and maintenance in a 3D scaffold. The device mimics the structure of a muscle connected to two tendons: Tendon-Muscle-Tendon (TMT). The TMT device is composed of a soft (E ∼ 6 kPa) porous (pore diameter: ∼650 μm) polyurethane scaffold, encased within a compliant silicone membrane to prevent medium evaporation. Two tendon-like hollow channels interface the scaffold with a fluidic circuit and a stretching device. We report an optimized protocol to sustain C2C12 adhesion by coating the scaffold with polydopamine and fibronectin. Then, we show the procedure for the soft scaffold inclusion in the TMT device, demonstrating the device's ability to bear multiple cycles of elongations, simulating a protocol for cell mechanical stimulation. By using computational fluid dynamic simulations, we show that a flow rate of 0.62 mL/min ensures a wall shear stress value safe for cells (<2 Pa) and 50% of scaffold coverage by an optimal fluid velocity.

The most important of these effects include cardioprotective, neuroprotective, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, osteoinductive, and anti-microbial effects. Resveratrol has cis and trans isoforms, with the trans isoform being more stable and biologically active. Despite the results of in vitro experiments, resveratrol has limited potential for application in vivo due to its poor water solubility, sensitivity to oxygen, light, and heat, rapid metabolism, and therefore low bioavailability. The possible solution to overcome these limitations could be the synthesis of resveratrol in nanoparticle form. Accordingly, in this study, we have developed a simple, green solvent/non-solvent physicochemical method to synthesize stable, uniform, carrier-free resveratrol nanobelt-like particles (ResNPs) for applications in tissue engineering. UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) was used to identify the trans isoform of ResNPs which remained stable for at least 63 days. The additional qualitative analysis was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), while X-ray diffraction (XRD) determined the monoclinic structure of resveratrol with a significant difference in the intensity of diffraction peaks between commercial and nano-belt form. The morphology of ResNPs was evaluated by optical microscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) that revealed a uniform nanobelt-like structure with an individual thickness of less than 1 μm. Bioactivity was confirmed using Artemia salina in vivo toxicity assay, while 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazylhydrate (DPPH) reduction assay showed the good antioxidative potential of concentrations of 100 μg/ml and lower. Microdilution assay on several reference strains and clinical isolates showed promising antibacterial potential on Staphylococci, with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) being 800 μg/ml.

Reversing cardiac fibrosis represents a key challenge in cardiac regenerative medicine. Reliable in vitro models of human cardiac fibrotic tissue could be useful for preclinical testing of new advanced therapies, addressing the limited predictivity of traditional 2D cell cultures and animal in vivo models. In this work, we engineered a biomimetic in vitro model, reproducing the morphological, mechanical, and chemical cues of native cardiac fibrotic tissue. Polycaprolactone (PCL)-based scaffolds with randomly oriented fibers were fabricated by solution electrospinning technique, showing homogeneous nanofibers with an average size of 131 ± 39 nm. PCL scaffolds were then surface-functionalized with human type I collagen (C1) and fibronectin (F) by dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-mediated mussel-inspired approach (PCL/polyDOPA/C1F), in order to mimic fibrotic cardiac tissue-like ECM composition and support human CF culture. BCA assay confirmed the successful deposition of the biomimetic coating and its stability during 5 days of incubation in phosphate-buffered saline. Immunostaining for C1 and F demonstrated their homogeneous distribution in the coating. AFM mechanical characterization showed that PCL/polyDOPA/C1F scaffolds, in wet conditions, resembled fibrotic tissue stiffness with an average Young's modulus of about 50 kPa. PCL/polyDOPA/C1F membranes supported human CF (HCF) adhesion and proliferation. Immunostaining for α-SMA and quantification of α-SMA-positive cells showed HCF activation into MyoFs in the absence of a transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) profibrotic stimulus, suggesting the intrinsic ability of biomimetic PCL/polyDOPA/C1F scaffolds to sustain the development of cardiac fibrotic tissue. A proof-of-concept study making use of a commercially available antifibrotic drug confirmed the potentialities of the developed in vitro model for drug efficacy testing.

The in vitro bioactivity studies and the antibacterial tests against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria revealed that the samples loaded with 2 mol% Nb2O5 had the highest bioactivity and greatest antibacterial effect.

In this study, we successfully fabricated polycaprolactone salt-leached scaffolds with two levels of a biomimetic calcium phosphate coating to examine their effects on MSC osteogenesis. Longer duration coating in simulated body fluid (SBF) led to increased HA crystal nucleation within scaffold interiors as well as more robust HA crystal formation on scaffold surfaces. Ultimately, the increased surface stiffness of scaffolds coated in SBF for 7 days in comparison to scaffolds coated in SBF for 1 day led to more robust osteogenesis of MSCs in vitro without the assistance of osteogenic signaling molecules. This study also demonstrated that the use of SBF-based HA coatings can promote higher levels of osteogenesis in vivo. Finally, when incorporated as the endplate region of a larger tissue-engineered intervertebral disc replacement, HA coating did not induce mineralization in or promote cell migration out of neighboring biomaterials. Overall, these results verified tunable biomimetic HA coatings as a promising biomaterial modification to promote discrete regions of mineralization within composite engineered tissues.","",""

However, conventional tissue-engineered periosteal materials have difficulty achieving these functions by simply mimicking the periosteum via structural design or by loading exogenous stem cells, cytokines, or growth factors. Herein, we present a novel biomimetic periosteum preparation strategy to comprehensively enhance the bone regeneration effect using functionalized piezoelectric materials. The resulting biomimetic periosteum possessing an excellent piezoelectric effect and improved physicochemical properties was prepared using a biocompatible and biodegradable poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid-co-3-hydrovaleric acid) (PHBV) polymer matrix, antioxidized polydopamine-modified hydroxyapatite (PHA), and barium titanate (PBT), which were further incorporated into the polymer matrix to fabricate a multifunctional piezoelectric periosteum by a simple one-step spin-coating method. The addition of PHA and PBT dramatically enhanced the physicochemical properties and biological functions of the piezoelectric periosteum, resulting in improved surface hydrophilicity and roughness, enhanced mechanical performance, tunable degradation behavior, and stable and desired endogenous electrical stimulations, which is conducive to accelerating bone regeneration. Benefiting from endogenous piezoelectric stimulation and bioactive components, the as-fabricated biomimetic periosteum demonstrated favorable biocompatibility, osteogenic activity, and immunomodulatory functions in vitro, which not only promoted adhesion, proliferation, and spreading as well as osteogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) but also effectively induced M2 macrophage polarization, thereby suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced inflammatory reactions. Through in vivo experiments, the biomimetic periosteum with endogenous piezoelectric stimulation synergistically accelerated the formation of new bone in a rat critical-sized cranial defect model. The whole defect was almost completely covered by new bone at 8 weeks post treatment, with a thickness close to that of the host bone. Collectively, with its favorable immunomodulatory and osteogenic properties, the biomimetic periosteum developed here represents a novel method to rapidly regenerate bone tissue using piezoelectric stimulation.","",""

Our work provides an example of PLLA scaffolds that were successfully 3D-printed with optimal porosity, pore size and fibre thickness. The compressive modulus was similar to, or better than, the trabecular bone of the mandible. PLLA scaffolds generated an electric potential upon cyclic/repeated loading. The crystallinity was reduced during the 3D printing. The hydrolytic degradation was relatively slow. Osteoblast-like cells did not attach to uncoated scaffolds but attached well and proliferated after coating the scaffold with fibrinogen. Collagen-based bio-ink scaffolds were also printed successfully. Osteoclast-like cells adhered, differentiated, and survived well on the scaffold. Efforts are underway to identify means to improve the structural stability of the collagen-based scaffolds, perhaps through mineralization by the polymer-induced liquid precursor process. 3D-printing technology is promising for constructing next-generation bone regeneration scaffolds. We describe our efforts to test PLLA and collagen scaffolds produced by 3D printing. The 3D-printed PLLA scaffolds showed promising properties akin to natural bone. Collagen scaffolds need further work to improve structural integrity. Ideally, such biological scaffolds will be mineralized to produce true bone biomimetics.

In particular, we deposited apatite on the electrospun fibers by Ionized Jet Deposition, a plasma-assisted technique that allows conformal deposition and the preservation in the coating of the target's stoichiometry.

Decellularisation was carried out on bone (B-ECM), liver (LIV-ECM), and small intestinal (SIS-ECM) tissues and the resultant dECM was biochemically and mechanically characterised. dECMh differed in mechanical and biochemical properties that likely had an effect on Schwann cell behaviour observed in metabolic activity and contraction profiles.

No difference was observed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurite extension between the dECMh groups and collagen I groups when applied as a coverslip coating, however, when DRG were seeded atop EngNT constructs, only the B-ECM derived EngNT performed similarly to collagen I derived EngNT.

To date, only a collagen hydrogel has been shown to be effective in the production and utilisation of EngNT in animal models.

For further functionalization, DNA/lipid-nanoparticles (lipoplexes) are incorporated into the multilayers. The polyelectrolyte multilayer fabrication and lipoplex deposition are analyzed by surface sensitive analytical methods that demonstrate successful thin-film formation, fibrillar structuring of collagen, and homogenous embedding of lipoplexes.

Excluded non-collagenous protein (NCPs) and carbohydrates also participate in critical cell signaling cascades and guide mineral deposition during intermediate stages of bone healing. By mimicking the native fracture repair process, polymeric scaffolds that incorporate calcium-binding moieties present in fibrocartilage can potentially enhance their bioactivity, mineralization, and bone growth. Likewise, coating polymeric fibers with serum albumin is an additional strategy that can impart collagen-like biofunctionality and further increase mineral deposition on the fibrous surface. Here, a combination of electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers with chondrocyte-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) and albumin coating were investigated as a fibrocartilage-mimetic scaffold that can serve as a woven bone precursor for bone regeneration. PCL fibrous constructs coated with dECM and albumin are shown to synergistically increase calcium concentration and calcium phosphate (CaP) deposition in a simulated body fluid biomineralization assay. Albumin/dECM coating increased osteoblast proliferation and mineral deposition in culture. In contrast, CaP coating transformed osteoblast bone lining morphology into cuboidal phenotype and arrested their proliferation. Cell sheets of osteoblasts cultured on dECM/albumin/CaP-coated constructs exhibited an increase in calcium deposition and secretion of collagen, osteopontin, osteocalcin, and bone morphogenetic protein. These results highlight the potential of biomolecular coatings to enhance bone-mimetic properties of synthetic nanofibrous scaffolds, stimulate critical protein and mineral deposition, and augment the bone's capacity to heal. Thus, mimicking the intermediate stages of bone regeneration by incorporating calcium-binding moieties may prove to be a useful strategy for improving the clinical outcomes of synthetic bone grafts.","",""

This approach to tissue engineering has tremendous potential for the development of reparative strategies to treat musculoskeletal injuries and diseases, especially for articular cartilage which has poor regenerative capacity. Additionally, many bioengineering and culture methods fail to maintain the chondrocyte phenotype and contain the correct matrix composition in the long term. Existing cartilage-engineering approaches have been developed, but many approaches involve complicated culture techniques and require foreign substances and biomaterials as scaffolds. While these scaffold-based approaches have numerous advantages, such as an instant or rapid creation of biomechanical properties, they frequently result in dedifferentiation of cells in part, due to the adherence to foreign scaffold materials. In this chapter, we describe a novel approach of developing a scaffold-less cartilage-like biomaterial, using the simple principle that cells at high density bear a capacity to coalesce when they cannot attach to any culture substrate. We refer to the biomaterial formed as a cartilage tissue equivalent or CTA and have published to describe their characteristics and utility in high-throughput drug screening. The method is described to generate reproducible cartilage analogs using a specialized high-density suspension culture technique using a hydrogel poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (polyHEMA) coating of a culture dish. We have demonstrated that this approach can rapidly form biomass of chondrocytes that over time becomes very synthetically active producing a cartilage-like extracellular matrix that closely mimics the biochemical and biomechanical characteristics of native articular cartilage. The culture approach can also be used to form CTA from other than articular cartilage-derived chondrocytes as well as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (while differentiating MSCs into chondrocytes). Some of the advantages are phenotype stability, reproducible CTA size, and biomechanical and biochemical characteristics similar to natural cartilage.","",""

In this study, we assessed QHM polymer cytocompatibility, amenability to fibrin-coating, immobilization and persistence of GDF-7, and capability to support GDF-7-mediated tendon differentiation in vitro as well as in vivo in mouse subcutaneous and acute rat rotator cuff tendon resection models. Cytocompatibility studies showed that QHM facilitated cell attachment, proliferation, and viability.

In vitro differentiation studies showed that GDF-7 mediated bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) tendon-like differentiation on 0 s UV QHM.

Together, our work demonstrates a promising synthetic scaffold with human tendon-like biomechanical attributes as well as immobilized tenogenic GDF-7 for tendon repair and regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Biological activity and mechanical robustness are key features required for tendon-promoting biomaterials. While synthetic biomaterials can be mechanically robust, they often lack bioactivity. To biologically augment synthetic biomaterials, numerous drug and GF delivery strategies exist but the large tissue space within the shoulder is constantly flushed with saline during arthroscopic surgery, hindering efficacious controlled release of therapeutic molecules. Here, we coated QHM polymer (which exhibits human tendon-to-bone-like biomechanical attributes) with fibrin for GF binding. Unlike conventional drug delivery strategies, our approach utilizes immobilized GFs as opposed to released GFs for sustained, localized tissue regeneration. Our data demonstrated that GF immobilization can be broadly applied to synthetic biomaterials for enhancing bioactivity, and GDF-7-immobilized QHM exhibit high clinical translational potential for tendon repair.","",""

This review summarizes previous approaches and highlights advances in vascularization strategies after implantation of surface-modified biomaterials for skin and bone tissue regeneration. The efficient integration of biomaterial, bioactive coating with endogenous degradable matrix proteins, physiochemical modifications, or surface geometry changes represents promising approaches. The results show that the induction of angiogenesis in the implant site as well as the vascularization of biomaterials can be influenced by specific surface modifications. The neovascularization of a biomaterial can be supported by the application of pro-angiogenic substances as well as by biomimetic surface coatings and physical or chemical surface activations. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the geometric properties of the three-dimensional biomaterial matrix play a central role, as they guide or even enable the ingrowth of blood vessels into a biomaterial.","",""

However, their interplay and the effects of different EF stimulation regimes on osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) are less investigated. In this study, we introduced EF with negligible magnetic field strength through a well-characterized transformer-like coupling (TLC) system, and applied EF disrupted (4/4) or consecutive (12/12) regime on type I collagen (Col) coatings with/without BGN over 28 days. Additionally, dexamethasone was excluded to enable an accurate interpretation of BGN and EF in supporting osteogenic differentiation. Here, we demonstrated the influences of BGN and EF on collagen topography and maintaining coating stability. Coupled with the release profile of Si ions from the BGN, cell proliferation and calcium deposition were enhanced in the Col-BGN samples after 28 days. Further, osteogenic differentiation was initiated as early as d 7, and each EF regime was shown to activate distinct pathways. The disrupted (4/4) regime was associated with the BMP/Smad4 pathways that up-regulate Runx2/OCN gene expression on d 7, with a lesser effect on ALP activity. In contrast, the canonical Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway activated through mechanotransduction cues is associated with the consecutive (12/12) regime, with significantly elevated ALP activity and Sp7 gene expression reported on d 7. In summary, our results illustrated the synergistic effects of BGN and EF in different stimulation regimes on osteogenic differentiation that can be further exploited to enhance current bone tissue engineering and regeneration approaches. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The unique release mechanisms of silica from bioactive glass nanoparticles (BGN) were coupled with pulsatile electric field (EF) stimulation to support hMSC osteogenic differentiation, in the absence of dexamethasone. Furthermore, the interplay with consecutive (12/12) and disrupted (4/4) stimulation regimes was investigated. The reported physical, mechanical and topographical effects of BGN and EF on the collagen coating, hMSC and the distinct progression of osteogenic differentiation (canonical Wnt/β-Catenin and BMP/Smad) triggered by respective stimulation regime were not explicitly reported previously. These results provide the fundamentals for further exploitations on BGN composites with metal ions and rotation of EF regimes to enhance osteogenic differentiation. The goal is sustaining continual osteogenic differentiation and achieving a more physiologically-relevant state and bone constructs in vitro.","",""

In this review, we briefly explore these mosquito-based innovations by discussing how unique characteristics and behaviors of mosquitoes drive the development of select biomaterials and medical devices. Mosquito-inspired microneedles have been fabricated from a variety of materials, including biocompatible metals and polymers, to mimic of the mouthparts that some mosquitoes use to bite a host with minimal injury during blood collection. The salivary components that these mosquitoes use to reduce the clotting of blood extracted during the biting process provide a rich source of anticoagulants that could potentially be integrated into blood-contacting biomaterials or administered in therapeutics to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Mosquito movement, vision, and olfaction are other behaviors that also have the potential for inspiring the development of medically relevant technologies. For instance, viscoelastic proteins that facilitate mosquito movement are being investigated for use in tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. Even the non-wetting nanostructure of a mosquito eye has inspired the creation of a robust superhydrophobic surface coating that shows promise for biomaterial and drug delivery applications. Additionally, biosensors incorporating mosquito olfactory receptors have been built to detect disease-specific volatile organic compounds. Advanced technologies derived from mosquitoes, and insects in general, form a research area that is ripe for exploration and can uncover potential in further dissecting mosquito features for the continued development of novel medical innovations.","",""

In this study, a silicon dioxide electret-incorporated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (SiO2/PDMS) composite electroactive membrane was designed and fabricated to explore its bone regeneration efficacy. SiO2 electrets were homogeneously dispersed in the PDMS matrix, and sandwich-like composite membranes were fabricated using a facile layer-by-layer blade-coating method.

The surface potential of the composite membrane could be adjusted to a bone-promotive biopotential by tuning the electret concentration, and the prepared membranes exhibited favorable electrical stability during an observation period of up to 42 days. In vitro biological experiments indicated that the electreted SiO2/PDMS membrane promoted cellular activity and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.

This method may be used for coating collagen on any relevant biomedical constructs made of synthetic polymers to increase their biocompatibility and cell attachment. Porous composite scaffolds fabricated by 3D printing were coated with collagen by a novel method and compared to traditional methods. After plasma treatment, samples were inverted in a homogenized collagen solution, freeze-dried, stabilized by crosslinking, freeze-dried again, and fibrillated using a defined salt concentration. Samples were characterized by a 3D laser microscope, cytocompatibility assay, attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, water absorption, protein absorption, and bioactivity assay.

A cardiovascular tissue substitute, which is gradually resorbed and is replaced by host's native tissue, has several advantages. Especially in children and young adults, a resorbable material can be useful in accommodating growth, but also enable rapid endothelialization that is necessary to avoid thrombotic complications. In this study, we report a hybrid material, wherein decellularized pericardial matrix is functionalized with a layer of polymeric nanofibers, to achieve the mechanical strength for implantation in the cardiovascular system, but also have enhanced cell honing capacity. Pericardial sacs were decellularized with sodium deoxycholate, and polycaprolactone-chitosan fibers were electrospun onto the matrix. Tissue-polymer interaction was evaluated using spectroscopic methods, and the mechanical properties of the individual components and the hybrid material were quantified. In-vitro blood flow loop studies were conducted to assess hemocompatibility and cell culture methods were used to assess biocompatibility. Encapsulation of the decellularized matrix with 70 μm thick matrix of polycaprolactone-chitosan nanofibers, was feasible and reproducible. Spectroscopy of the cross-section depicted new amide bond formation and C-O-C stretch at the interface. An average peel strength of 56.13 ± 11.87 mN/mm2 was measured, that is sufficient to withstand a high shear of 15 dynes/cm2 without delamination. Mechanical strength and extensibility ratio of the decellularized matrix alone were 18,000 ± 4,200 KPa and 0.18 ± 0.03% whereas that of the hybrid was higher at 20,000 ± 6,600 KPa and 0.35 ± 0.20%. Anisotropy index and stiffness of the biohybrid were increased as well. Neither thrombus formation, nor platelet adhesion or hemolysis was measured in the in-vitro blood flow loop studies.

Importantly, Sr-doped bone-like apatite could form and fully cover the 3D printed scaffolds surface in hours. The characterization results indicated that Sr2+ ions successfully replaced Ca2+ ions in bone-like apatite and the molar ratio of Sr/(Ca+Sr) was up to 8.2%. Furthermore, the Sr-doped apatite coating increased the compressive strength and Young's modulus of composite scaffolds. The compatibility and bioactivity of mineralized scaffolds were evaluated by cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. It was found that Sr-doped apatite coating could gradually release Sr2+ ions and further promote cell attachment, proliferation rate, and the expression of alkaline phosphatase activity and osteogenic related genes, such as collagen type I (Col I), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx-2), osteopontin, and osterix. Therefore, the Sr-doped apatite coating fabricated by this facile and rapid biomineralization process offers a new strategy to modify 3D printed porous scaffolds with significantly improved mechanical and biological properties for bone tissue engineering applications.","",""

Topographical information for the plasma-treated pNIPAAM coatings obtained by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements evidenced a more compact surface for Ar treatment due to combined etching and redeposition, while for oxygen, a clear increase of pores diameter is noticed. The chemical surface composition as determined by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy showed the specific modifications induced by plasma treatment, namely strong oxidation for oxygen plasma treatment illustrated by eight times increase of O-C=O contribution and respectively an increase of C-N/O=C-N bonds in the case of ammonia plasma treatment. Structural information provided by FTIR spectroscopy reveals a significant increase of the carboxylic group upon argon and mostly oxygen plasma treatment and the increase in width and intensity of the amide-related groups for the ammonia plasma treatment. The biological investigations evidenced that L929 fibroblast cells viability is increased by 25% upon plasma treatment, while the cell attachment is up to 2.8 times higher for the oxygen plasma-treated surface compared to the initial spin-coated pNIPAAM. Moreover, the cell detachment process proved to be up to 2-3 times faster for the oxygen and argon plasma-treated surfaces and up to 1.5 times faster for the ammonia-treated surface. These results show the versatility of plasma treatment for inducing beneficial chemical modifications of pNIPAAM surfaces that allows the tuning of cellular response for improving the attachment-detachment process in view of tissue engineering.","",""

The three main treatment strategies for bone defects and recalcitrant nonunions are synthetic bone graft substitutes (BGS), BGS combined with bioactive molecules, and BGS and stem cells (cell-based constructs). Regarding BGS, numerous biomaterials have been developed to prepare bone tissue engineering scaffolds, including biometals (titanium, iron, magnesium, zinc), bioceramics (hydroxyapatite (HA)), tricalcium phosphate (TCP), biopolymers (collagen, polylactic acid (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL)), and biocomposites (HA/MONs@miR-34a composite coating, Bioglass (BG)-based ABVF-BG (antibiotic-releasing bone void filling) putty). Bone tissue engineering scaffolds are temporary implants that promote tissue ingrowth and new bone regeneration. They have been developed to improve bone healing through appropriate designs in terms of geometric, mechanical, and biological performance. Concerning BGS combined with bioactive molecules, one of the most potent osteoinductive growth factors is bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). In recent years, several natural (collagen, fibrin, chitosan, hyaluronic acid, gelatin, and alginate) and synthetic polymers (polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polylactic-coglycolide, poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL), poly-p-dioxanone, and copolymers consisting of glycolide/trimethylene carbonate) have been investigated as potential support materials for bone tissue engineering.

However, long-term implantation is usually associated with complications, such as capsular contracture due to excessive local inflammatory response, subsequently requiring implant removal. Therefore, modification of the silicone surface to reduce a risk of capsular contracture has attracted increasing attention. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) are known to provide potentially therapeutic applications for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and reconstructive surgery. Herein, hASCs coating on a PDMS (hASC-PDMS) or itaconic acid (IA)-conjugated PDMS (hASC-IA-PDMS) surface is examined to determine its biocompatibility for reducing capsular contracture on the PDMS surface. In vitro cell cytotoxicity evaluation showed that hASCs on IA-PDMS exhibit higher cell viability than hASCs on PDMS. A lower release of proinflammatory cytokines is observed in hASC-PDMS and hASC-IA-PDMS compared to the cells on plate. Multiple factors, including in vivo mRNA expression levels of cytokines related to fibrosis; number of inflammatory cells; number of macrophages and myofibroblasts; capsule thickness; and collagen density following implantation in rats for 60 days, indicate that incorporated coating hASCs on PDMSs most effectively reduces capsular contracture.

In these cases, implantation of tissue engineering scaffold could be indicated. Currently, two commercial scaffolds, based on collagen or polycaprolactone-polyurethane (PCL-PU), are available for meniscus scaffolding. In short term follow-up assessments, both showed clinical improvement and tissue formation. However, long-term studies carried out in PCL-PU showed that the new tissue decreased in volume and assumed an irregular shape. Moreover, in some cases, the scaffold was totally reabsorbed, without new tissue formation.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) combined with scaffolds could represents a promising approach for treating meniscal defects because of their multipotency and self-renewal. In this work, we aimed to compare the behaviour of MSCs and chondrocytes on a PCL-PU scaffold in vitro. MSCs express integrins that binds to fibronectin (FN), so we also investigate the effect of a FN coating on the bioactivity of the scaffold. We isolated rabbit bone marrow MSCs (rBM-MSCs) from two skeletally mature New Zealand white rabbits and stablished the optimum culture condition to expand them. Then, they were seeded over non-coated and FN-coated scaffolds and cultured in chondrogenic conditions. To evaluate cell functionality, we performed an MTS assay to compare cell proliferation between both conditions. Finally, a histologic study was performed to assess extracellular matrix (ECM) production in both samples, and to compare them with the ones obtained with rabbit chondrocytes (rCHs) seeded in a non-coated scaffold. A culture protocol based on low FBS concentration was set as the best for rBM-MSCs expansion. The MTS assay revealed that rBM-MSCs seeded on FN-coated scaffolds have more cells on proliferation (145%; 95% CI: 107%-182%) compared with rBM-MSCs seeded on non-coated scaffolds. Finally, the histologic study demonstrated that rCHs seeded on non-coated scaffolds displayed the highest production of ECM, followed by rBM-MSCs seeded on FN-coated scaffolds. Furthermore, both cell types produced a comparable ECM pattern. These results suggest that MSCs have low capacity attachment to PCL-PU scaffolds, but the presence of integrin alpha5beta1 (FN-receptor) in MSCs allows them to interact with the FN-coated scaffolds. These results could be applied in the design of scaffolds, and might have important clinical implications in orthopaedic surgery of meniscal injuries.","",""

In order to enhance scaffold bioactivity for human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) culture, scaffold surface modification through the physical absorption of collagen I and fibronectin (FN) were investigated by cell live/dead staining and cell viability assays. The results indicated that coating with fibronectin outperformed coating with collagen I in promoting multiple-aspect stem cell functions, and fibronectin favors long-term culture required for chondrogenesis on scaffolds. In situ chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs resulted in a time-dependent upregulation of SOX9 and extracellular matrix (ECM) assessed by qRT-PCR analysis, and enhanced deposition of collagen II and aggrecan confirmed by immunostaining and western blot analysis. Gene expression data also revealed 3D porous scaffolds coupled with surface functionalization greatly facilitated chondrogenesis of hMSCs. In addition, the subcutaneous implantation of 3D porous PU scaffolds on SD rats did not induce local inflammation and integrated well with surrounding tissues, suggesting good in vivo biocompatibility.

This paper presents a systematic investigation of biomimetic composite (BC) coatings on Ti implant surfaces in a rat model of a diaphyseal femoral fracture. Methodological approaches of surface modification of the Ti implants via the usual joining methods (e.g., grit blasting and acid etching) and advanced physicochemical coating via a self-assembled dip-coating method were used. The biomimetic procedure used multi-substituted hydroxyapatite (ms-HAP) HAP-1.5 wt% Mg-0.2 wt% Zn-0.2 wt% Si nanoparticles (NPs), which were functionalized using collagen type 1 molecules (COL), resulting in ms-HAP/COL (core/shell) NPs that were embedded into a polylactic acid (PLA) matrix and finally covered with COL layers, obtaining the ms-HAP/COL@PLA/COL composite. To assess the osseointegration issue, first, the thickness, surface morphology and roughness of the BC coating on the Ti implants were determined using AFM and SEM. The BC-coated Ti implants and uncoated Ti implants were then used in Wistar albino rats with a diaphyseal femoral fracture, both in the absence and the presence of high-frequency pulsed electromagnetic shortwave (HF-PESW) stimulation. This study was performed using a bone marker serum concentration and histological and computer tomography (micro-CT) analysis at 2 and 8 weeks after surgical implantation. The implant osseointegration was evaluated through the bone-implant contact (BIC). The bone-implant interface was investigated using FE-SEM images and EDX spectra of the retrieved surgical implants at 8 weeks in the four animal groups. The obtained results showed significantly higher bone-implants contact and bone volume per tissue volume, as well as a greater amount of newly formed bone, in the BC-coated Ti implants than in the uncoated Ti implants. Direct bone-implant contact was also confirmed via histological examination. The results of this study confirmed that these biomimetic composite coatings on Ti implants were essential for a significant enhancement of osseointegration of BC-coated Ti implants and bone regeneration.

As seen from the results, modification of CA does not change the original structural characteristics of MTA, thus allowing us to retain the properties of MTA. CA-coated MTA scaffolds were shown to have 25% to 55% higher results than bare scaffold. In addition, CA-coated MTA scaffolds were able to significantly adsorb more vascular endothelial growth factors (p < 0.05) secreted from human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs). More importantly, CA-coated MTA scaffolds not only promoted the adhesion and proliferation behaviors of hDPSCs, but also enhanced angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Finally, CA-coated MTA scaffolds led to enhanced subsequent in vivo bone regeneration of the femur of rabbits, which was confirmed using micro-computed tomography and histological staining.

Collagen coating on 3D-printed β-TCP scaffolds slowed the release of plasmid DNA encoding miR-200c compared to noncoated constructs. 3D-printed β-TCP scaffolds coated with miR-200c-incorporated collagen increased the transfection efficiency of miR-200c of both rat and human BMSCs and additionally increased osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in vitro.

Col and Col-rGO scaffolds were synthesized by chemical crosslinking and freeze-drying methods. The surface topography, and the mechanical and chemical properties of scaffolds were characterized, showing three-dimensional (3D) porous scaffolds and successful coating of rGO on Col. The rGO coating enhanced the mechanical strength of Col-rGO scaffolds to a greater extent than Col scaffolds by 2.8 times. Furthermore, Col-rGO scaffolds confirmed that graphene addition induced no cytotoxic effects and enhanced the viability and proliferation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) with 3D adherence and expansion. Finally, scaffold implantation into rabbit cranial bone defects for 12 weeks showed increased bone formation, confirmed by Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) and alizarin red staining.

Dried acellular dermal matrix (DADM), hydrated acellular dermal matrix (HADM), non-crosslinked collagen matrix (NCM), and crosslinked collagen matrix (CCM) did all enhance the motility of the osteoprogenitor cells. Compared to DADM and NCM, HADM and CCM triggered stronger migratory response. While cells grown on DADM and NCM demonstrated proliferative rates comparable to control cells grown in the absence of a biomaterial, cells grown on HADM and CCM proliferated significantly faster. The pro-proliferative effects of the two matrices were supported by upregulated expression of genes regulating cell division. Increased expression of genes encoding the adhesive molecules fibronectin, vinculin, CD44 antigen, and the intracellular adhesive molecule-1 was detected in cells grown on each of the scaffolds, suggesting excellent adhesive properties of the investigated biomaterials. In contrast to genes encoding the bone matrix proteins collagen type I (Col1a1) and osteopontin (Spp1) induced by all matrices, the expression of the osteogenic differentiation markers Runx2, Alpl, Dlx5, Ibsp, Bglap2, and Phex was significantly increased in cells grown on HADM and CCM only. Short/clinically relevant pre-coating of the 3D biomaterials with enamel matrix derivative (EMD) or recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rBMP-2) significantly boosted the osteogenic differentiation of both osteoprogenitor lines on all matrices, including DADM and NCM, indicating that EMD and BMP-2 retained their biological activity after being released from the matrices. Whereas EMD triggered the expression of all osteogenesis-related genes, rBMP-2 upregulated early, intermediate, and late osteogenic differentiation markers except for Col1a1 and Spp1.

Moreover, to assess the potential osteoblast-osteoclast cross-talk phenomenon and the influence of signaling molecules released by osteoclasts on osteoblast cell culture, a medium obtained from osteoclast culture (OSC) was also used. To impel the cells to adhere and grow on the MS, anti-adhesive cell culture plates were utilized. The results show that MS coated with PLL and COL significantly favor the adhesion and growth of MC3T3-E1 cells on days 1 and 7, respectively, in all experimental conditions tested.

Graphene-based scaffolds combined with stem cells deserve special attention to enhance tissue regeneration in a controlled manner. However, it is believed that minor changes in scaffold biomaterial composition, internal porous structure, and physicochemical properties can impact cellular growth and adhesion. The current work aims to investigate in vitro biological effects of three-dimensional (3D) graphene oxide (GO)/sodium alginate (GOSA) and reduced GOSA (RGOSA) scaffolds on dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in terms of cell viability and cytotoxicity. Herein, the effects of the 3D scaffolds, coating conditions, and serum supplementation on DPSCs functions are explored extensively. Biodegradation analysis revealed that the addition of GO enhanced the degradation rate of composite scaffolds. Compared to the 2D surface, the cell viability of 3D scaffolds was higher (p < 0.0001), highlighting the optimal initial cell adhesion to the scaffold surface and cell migration through pores. Moreover, the cytotoxicity study indicated that the incorporation of graphene supported higher DPSCs viability. It is also shown that when the mean pore size of the scaffold increases, DPSCs activity decreases. In terms of coating conditions, poly- l-lysine was the most robust coating reagent that improved cell-scaffold adherence and DPSCs metabolism activity. The cytotoxicity of GO-based scaffolds showed that DPSCs can be seeded in serum-free media without cytotoxic effects. This is critical for human translation as cellular transplants are typically serum-free. These findings suggest that proposed 3D GO-based scaffolds have favorable effects on the biological responses of DPSCs.","",""

SF is an excellent biomaterial for tissue engineering. However neuronal cells, such as rat PC12 cells, showed poor attachment on pure regenerated SF (RSF) scaffold surfaces.

The cellular alumina support was characterized with respect to its cellular/porous structure and niche accessibility and coating thickness of the refractory metals; the average cell size was 2.3 mm, the average size of the cell windows was 1.8 mm, and the total foam porosity was 91.4%. The Pt, Ti and Ta coatings were completely dense covering the entire alumina foam surface. The metals titanium and tantalum were colonized very well by the stem cells without a coating of ECM components, whereas the fibroblasts preferred components of the ECM on the alumina foam surface.","",""

Electrochemical sensing with fast response and high sensitivity has played a vital role in real-time monitoring of living cells, but most current sensors are based on planar electrodes and fail to perfectly match the 3D cell culture matrix. Herein, we developed a robust 3D electrochemical sensor based on functionalized graphene foam (GF), which could be integrated with hydrogels for the 3D culture and in situ monitoring of cells for the first time. Specifically, platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) electrodeposited on GF (GF/Pt NPs) conferred the prominent electrochemical sensing performance, and the anti-fouling coating of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) endowed the GF/Pt NPs electrode with greatly improved stability. As a proof of concept, collagen hydrogel with microglia seeded in was filled into the interspace of the 3D GF/Pt NPs/PEDOT sensor to establish an integrated platform, which allowed the successful real-time monitoring of reactive oxygen species released from microglia in the collagen matrix.

Due to the low amounts of testosterone and alendronate used, sensitive in vitro assays were developed to determine in vitro release. The ultrasonic spray coating technology was optimized for coating titanium screws and pericardial collagen membranes, with the aim to improve osseo-integration and (guided) bone regeneration, respectively, without interfering with their primary mode of action. In vitro release analysis of collagen membranes and screws showed up to 21 days sustained release of the compounds without a burst release. Subsequent preclinical studies in rat and rabbit models indicated that testosterone and alendronate coated membranes and screws significantly improved bone regeneration in vivo. Coated membranes significantly improved the formation of new bone in a critical size calvarial defect model in rats (by 160% compared to controls). Coated screws implanted in rabbit femoral condyles significantly improved bone implant contact (69% vs 54% in controls), bone mineral density (121%) and bone volume (119%) up to 1.3 mm from the implant. Based on the results obtained, we suggest that implants or membranes enabled with local sustained delivery of ancillary amounts of testosterone and alendronate can be a promising system to stimulate local bone regeneration resulting in improved osseo-integration of implants and improved healing of bone defects and fractures.","",""

In this study, SF scaffolds were coated with fibronectin/gelatin (Fn/G) to improve cell adhesion. Furthermore, the effect of pore size in Fn/G coated SF scaffolds on osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were investigated in vitro. Scaffolds with average pore diameters of 384.52, 275.23, and 173.8 μm were prepared by salt leaching method, labelled as Large, Medium, and Small group. Porcine BMSCs were seeded on scaffolds and cultured in osteogenic medium for 21 days to evaluate cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium deposition, gene expression of osteogenic markers, and histological performance.

The number and the spreading area of the initially adhered cells, their growth rate during 7 days after seeding and the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly higher on the NCD-coated samples than on the uncoated O-SiOx samples. In addition, the concentration of type I collagen was significantly higher in the cells on the O-NCD-coated samples than on the bare O-SiOx samples. The observed differences could be attributed to the tunable wettability of NCD and to the more appropriate surface morphology of the NCD-coated samples in contrast to the less stable, rapidly eroding bare SiOx surface. The H-NCD coatings and the O-NCD coatings both promoted similar initial adhesion of Saos-2 cells, but the subsequent cell proliferation activity was higher on the O-NCD-coated samples. The concentration of beta-actin, vinculin, type I collagen and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the ALP activity, and also the calcium deposition tended to be higher in the cells on the O-NCD-coated samples than on the H-NCD-coated samples, although these differences did not reach statistical significance. The improved cell performance on the O-NCD-coated samples could be attributed to higher wettability of these samples (water drop contact angle less than 10°), while the H-NCD-coated samples were hydrophobic (contact angle >70°). NCD-coated porous SiOx meshes can therefore be considered as appropriate scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, particularly those with an O-terminated NCD coating.","",""

However, these materials face challenges in terms of pore-size limitations since they are characterized by nanopores ranging between 6-8 nm and thus unsuitable to host large molecular weight molecules such as proteins, enzymes and growth factors (GFs). In this work, for an application in the field of bone regeneration, large-pore mesoporous silicas (LPMSs) were developed to vehicle large biomolecules and release them under a pH stimulus. Considering bone remodeling, the proposed pH-triggered mechanism aims to mimic the release of GFs encased in the bone matrix due to bone resorption by osteoclasts (OCs) and the associated pH drop. To this aim, LPMSs were prepared by using 1,3,5-trimethyl benzene (TMB) as a swelling agent and the synthesis solution was hydrothermally treated and the influence of different process temperatures and durations on the resulting mesostructure was investigated. The synthesized particles exhibited a cage-like mesoporous structure with accessible pores of diameter up to 23 nm. LPMSs produced at 140 °C for 24 h showed the best compromise in terms of specific surface area, pores size and shape and hence, were selected for further experiments. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used as model protein to evaluate the ability of the LPMSs to adsorb and release large biomolecules. After HRP-loading, LPMSs were coated with a pH-responsive polymer, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), allowing the release of the incorporated biomolecules in response to a pH decrease, in an attempt to mimic GFs release in bone under the acidic pH generated by the resorption activity of OCs. The reported results proved that PEG-coated carriers released HRP more quickly in an acidic environment, due to the protonation of PEG at low pH that catalyzes polymer hydrolysis reaction. Our findings indicate that LPMSs could be used as carriers to deliver large biomolecules and prove the effectiveness of PEG as pH-responsive coating. Finally, as proof of concept, a collagen-based suspension was obtained by incorporating PEG-coated LPMS carriers into a type I collagen matrix with the aim of designing a hybrid formulation for 3D-printing of bone scaffolds.","",""

We revealed that EGCG-coating on polycaprolactone (PCL) film surface increased hydrophilicity and anti-oxidative properties as a function of total phenol content (TPC) potentially due to the increase in phenolic -OH and π-electrons from structural maintenance and directly removed the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by resonance-stabilization.

This paper intends to investigate jellyfish collagen (Jellagen®) in two applications. This investigation aims to establish an initial understanding of jellyfish collagen in biotechnology. More specifically, in cell culture and the field of tissue engineering. The jellyfish collagen was comparatively tested as a coating material for multi-well plates as one of the most extensively used tools in cell culture and in the form of three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds intended for bone tissue engineering (BTE) applications. Both, the coated well plates and the scaffolds were seeded with fibroblasts and pre-osteoblasts, separately. In vitro cytocompatibility assays in accordance with EN ISO 10993-5/-12 regulations and LIVE-DEAD-stainings were carried out to study the cell viability, cytotoxicity and proliferation of these two cell lines. The results showed that collagen extracted from R. pulmo jellyfish can be an alternative to mammalian-derived collagen. Fibroblasts showed comparable cell viability to the medium control and an increased cell proliferation on the well plates indicating that these coated well plates can be used in cell culture, particularly in biocompatibility studies of biomaterials (as fibroblasts are used in this respective field extensively). The viability of pre-osteoblasts significantly exceeded the medium control in case of the jellyfish 3D scaffolds.

Chemically modified mRNA (cmRNA) is a new form of therapeutic that has been used to induce bone healing. Combined with biomaterials, cmRNA can be used to develop transcript-activated matrices for local protein production with osteoinductive potential. In this study, we aimed to utilize this technology to create bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) transcript-activated coatings for titanium (Ti) implants. Therefore, different coating methodologies as well as cmRNA incorporation strategies were evaluated. Three different biocompatible biomaterials were used for the coating of Ti, namely, poly-d,l-lactic acid (PDLLA), fibrin, and fibrinogen. cmRNA-coated Ti disks were assayed for transfection efficiency, cmRNA release, cell viability and proliferation, and osteogenic activity in vitro. We found that cmRNA release was significantly delayed in Ti surfaces previously coated with biomaterials. Consequently, the transfection efficiency was greatly improved. PDLLA coating improved the transfection efficiency in a concentration-dependent manner. Lower PDLLA concentration used for the coating of Ti resulted in higher transfection efficiency. Fibrin and fibrinogen coatings showed even higher transfection efficiencies compared to all PDLLA concentrations. In those disks, not only the expression was up to 24-fold higher but also the peak of maximal expression was delayed from 24 h to 5 days, and the duration of expression was also extended until 7 days post-transfection. For fibrin, higher transfection efficiencies were obtained in the coatings with the lowest thrombin amounts. Accordingly, fibrinogen coatings gave the best results in terms of cmRNA transfection. All biomaterial-coated Ti surfaces showed improved cell viability and proliferation, though this was more noticeable in the fibrinogen-coated disks. The latter was also the only coating to support significant amounts of BMP2 produced by C2C12 cells in vitro. Osteogenesis was confirmed using BMP2 cmRNA fibrinogen-coated Ti disks, and it was dependent of the cmRNA amount present. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of C2C12 increased when using fibrinogen coatings containing 250 ng of cmRNA or more. Similarly, mineralization was also observed that increased with increasing cmRNA concentration. Overall, our results support fibrinogen as an optimal material to deliver cmRNA from titanium-coated surfaces.","",""

Furthermore, BBCP1 significantly promoted new bone area as compared to other three groups and more bone volume as compared to the control. Within its limitations, this study indicated the highest degradation rate in case of BBCP1 concomitant with the highest rate of bone formation.

Then, calcium peroxide (CPO) particles, as an oxygen-releasing agent, were coated on the BCP scaffolds. Segmental radial defects with the size of 15 mm were created in rabbits. Uncoated and CPO-coated BCP scaffolds were implanted in the defects. The empty (control) group received no implantation. Repairing of the bone was investigated via X-ray, histological analysis, and biomechanical tests at 3 and 6 months postoperatively, with immunohistochemical examinations at 6 months after operation. According to the radiological observations, formation of new bone was augmented at the interface between the implant and host bone and internal pores of CPO-coated BCP scaffolds compared to uncoated scaffolds. Histomorphometry analysis represented that the amount of newly formed bone in the CPO-coated scaffold was nearly two times higher than the uncoated one. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that osteogenic markers, osteonectin and octeocalcin, were overexpressed in the defects treated with the coated scaffolds at 6 months of postsurgery, demonstrating higher osteogenic differentiation and bone mineralization compared to the uncoated scaffold group. Furthermore, the coated scaffolds had superior biomechanical properties as in the case of 3 months after surgery, the maximal flexural force of the coated scaffolds reached to 134 N, while it was 92 N for uncoated scaffolds.

Compared to conventional gelatin hydrogels, macroporous gelatin μRB scaffolds demonstrated great advantage in enhancing mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based cartilage formation. However, whether gelatin-based μRBs support MSC osteogenesis and bone formation remains unknown. The goal of this study is to assess the potential of gelatin-based μRBs for supporting MSC-based osteogenesis and bone formation in vitro. Given recent evidence from the literature that osteogenesis is sensitive to substrate stiffness, we further investigate how varying μRB stiffness modulates MSC osteogenesis. We first determine the maximal stiffness range of gelatin μRBs that can be fabricated (13-57 kPa), which supports both retention of μRB shape and macroporosity within scaffolds after inter-cross-linking. Interestingly, varying μRB stiffness across a broad range of stiffness did not significantly impact osteogenesis, with all groups supporting upregulation of bone markers and extensive collagen deposition. All gelatin μRBs also supported a comparable level of cell spreading and upregulation of mechanosensing markers. However, soft μRB (13 kPa) scaffolds did not maintain structural integrity and condensed into a pellet over time. Both intermediate and stiff gelatin μRB-based scaffolds maintained their integrity and supported robust bone formation, leading to a more than 10-fold increase in the compressive moduli of engineered bone after 5 weeks of culture in osteogenic media. Incorporating hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticle coating onto the gelatin μRB surface further accelerated the maturation of MSCs into osteoblasts and mineralization.

To date the appropriate combination of biophysical and biochemical factors that can be used to engineer such a biomaterial substrate remain unknown. Here we show that microfiber scaffolds functionalized with tissue-specific extracellular matrix (ECM) components can direct the differentiation of MSCs toward the phenotypes seen at the bone-ligament interface. Ligament-ECM (L-ECM) promoted the expression of the ligament-marker gene tenomodulin (TNMD) and higher levels of type I and III collagen expression compared to functionalization with commercially available type I collagen. Functionalization of microfiber scaffolds with cartilage-ECM (C-ECM) promoted chondrogenesis of MSCs, as evidenced by adoption of a round cell morphology and increased SRY-box 9 (SOX9) expression in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Next, we fabricated a multiphasic scaffold by controlling the spatial presentation of L-ECM and C-ECM along the length of a single electrospun microfiber construct, with the distal region of the C-ECM coated fibers additionally functionalized with an apatite layer (using simulated body fluid) to promote endochondral ossification. These ECM functionalized scaffolds promoted spatially defined differentiation of MSCs, with higher expression of TNMD observed in the region functionalized with L-ECM, and higher expression of type X collagen and osteopontin (markers of endochondral ossification) observed at the end of the scaffold functionalized with C-ECM and the apatite coating.

However, orchestring multitude attributes of skin ECM yet presents an intriguing challenge to be addressed. In the present work, we have developed an in vitro skin scaffold by coating a bio-mimetic ECM cue κ-carrageenan on electrospun nanofibers for the first time. κ-Carrageenan, a natural sulfated algal polysaccharide exhibits close similarity with native glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) of skin ECM. On the other hand, electrospun nanofibers resemble the 3D nano-topographic architecture of ECM. In the coated form, κ-carrageenan could provide the biochemical cues necessary for cellular functions on the nanofibrous scaffold, thereby mimicking the native 3D microenvironment of skin ECM. The nano-architecture of the electrospun matrix is retained in the fabricated scaffold even after coating with κ-carrageenan. The developed biomimetic scaffold significantly supplements adhesion, growth, infiltration, survival and proliferation of fibroblasts. Furthermore, enhanced gene expression and excessive secretion of collagen proteins by fibroblasts communicate a conducive skin ECM micro-environment formation on the algal polysaccharide coated nanofibrous scaffold. Taken together, these findings present a simple yet effective strategy for the fabrication of ECM mimetic scaffold for promising skin tissue engineering applications.","",""

Dry surface modification techniques, including irradiation and plasma treatment, offer an alternative to the conventional wet chemistry strategies to modify the physical and chemical properties of silk materials without compromising their bulk properties. While dry surface modification techniques are more prevalent in textiles and sterilization applications, the range of modifications available and resultant changes to silk materials all point to the utility of dry surface modification for the development of new, functional silk biomaterials.

However, the biocompatibility of a high amount of yttria is still an important topic that needs to be investigated. Commercially available 8YTZP plates were used. To enhance cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, the surface of the 8YTZP is sequentially polished with a SiC-coated abrasive paper and surface coating with type I collagen.

To answer this question, in this study, we developed a layered coating consisting of a Se nanoparticle layer underneath a micrometer-thick, biomimetic calcium phosphate (CaP) layer. We showed, for the first time, that the release of soluble HSe- ions from the Se nanoparticles strongly inhibited planktonic growth and biofilm formation of key bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus. The Se-CaP coating was found to support higher bone formation than the CaP-only coating in critical-size calvarial defects in rats; this finding could be directly attributed to the released soluble Se ions as the CaP layers in both groups had no detectable differences in the porous morphology, chemistry, and release of Ca or P.

Electrospinning is one of the most often used approaches to fabricate SF fibrous scaffolds; yet, this technique still faces many challenges, such as low yield, residual organic solvents, limited extensibility of fibers, and a lack of spatial control over pore size. To circumvent these limitations, a core-shell SF on rice paper (SF@RP) fibrous scaffold was fabricated using a mild one-step dip-coating method. The cellulose fiber matrix of RP is the physical basis of the 3D scaffold, whereas the SF coating on the cellulose fiber controls the adhesion/spreading of the cells. The results indicated that by tuning the secondary structure of SF on the surface of a SF@RP scaffold, the cell behavior on SF@RP could be tuned. Tumor spheroids can be formed on SF@RP scaffolds with a dominant random secondary structure, in contrast to cells adhering and spreading on SF@RP scaffolds with a higher ratio of β-sheet secondary structures. Direct culturing of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, lung cancer A549, prostate cancer DU145, and liver cancer HepG2 cells could spontaneously lead to corresponding tumor spheroids on SF@RP. In addition, the physiological characteristics of HepG2 tumor spheroids were investigated, and the results showed that compared with HepG2 monolayer cells, CYP3A4, CYP1A1, and albumin gene expression levels in HepG2 cell spheres formed on SF@RP scaffolds were significantly higher.

The relative contributions of the nanotopographical pattern (physical factor) and gelatin coating (chemical factor) in enhancing the mechanical and adhesive properties of PCL were quantitatively investigated. The nanotopographical pattern increased the surface area of PCL, allowing more gelatin to be coated on its surface. The biomedical patch made from gelatin-coated nanopatterned PCL showed strong mechanical and adhesive properties (tensile strength: ~14.5 MPa; Young's modulus: ~60.2 MPa; and normal and shear adhesive forces: ~1.81 N/cm2 and ~352.3 kPa) as well as good biocompatibility. Although the nanotopographical pattern or gelatin coating alone could enhance these physical properties of PCL in both dry and wet environmental conditions, both factors in combination further strengthened the properties, indicating the importance of synergistic cues in driving the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials.

The osteogenic potential of combining matrices and protein growth factors has been well documented, however, improvements are necessary to achieve optimal therapeutic benefits upon clinical translation. In this article, rat calvarial defects were treated with gene-activated matrices (GAMs). The GAMs used were collagen sponges mineralized with a simulated body fluid (SBF) containing a nonviral gene delivery system. Both in vitro and in vivo studies were performed to determine the optimal mode of gene delivery. After 6 weeks, the defects were extracted to assess bone formation and tissue quality through histological and microcomputed tomography analyses. The optimal GAM consisted of a collagen sponge with polyethylenimine plasmid DNA (PEI-pDNA) complexes embedded in a calcium phosphate coating produced by SBF, which increased total bone formation by 39% compared with 19% for control samples. A follow-up in vivo study was performed to optimize the ratio of growth factors included in the GAM. The optimal ratio for supporting bone formation after 6 weeks of implantation was five parts of pBMP-2 to three parts pFGF-2. These studies demonstrated that collagen matrices biomimetically mineralized and activated with plasmids encoding fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) can optimally improve bone regeneration outcomes.

Combinations of piezoelectric polymers with magnetostrictive nanoparticles (MNP) can be used to magnetoelectrically stimulate cells by applying an external magnetic field which deforms the magnetostrictive nanoparticles in the polymer matrix, deforming the polymer itself, which varies the surface charge due to the piezoelectric effect. Poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF) is the piezoelectric polymer with the largest piezoelectric coefficients, being a perfect candidate for osteogenic differentiation. As a first approach, in this paper, we propose PVDF membranes containing magnetostrictive nanoparticles and a biomimetic heparin/collagen layer-by-layer (LbL) coating for mesenchymal stem cell culture. PVDF membranes 20% (w/v) with and without cobalt ferrite oxide (PVDF-CFO) 10% (w/w) were produced by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS). These membranes were found to be asymmetric, with a smooth surface, crystallinity ranging from 65% to 61%, and an electroactive β-phase content of 51.8% and 55.6% for PVDF and PVDF-CFO, respectively. Amine groups were grafted onto the membrane surface by an alkali treatment, confirmed by ninhydrin test and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), providing positive charges for the assembly of heparin/collagen layers by the LbL technique. Five layers of each polyelectrolyte were deposited, ending with collagen. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) were used to test cell response in a short-term culture (1, 3 and 7 days).

Understanding biomineralization strategies could enhance opportunities for novel biomimetic mineralization approaches.

Polydopamine (PDA) has emerged as a promising material for biomaterial functionalization, considering its simple molecular structure, independence of target materials, cell interactions for adhesion, and robust reactivity for resulting functionalization. In this review, we highlight the strategies for using PDA to induce the biomineralization of hydroxyapatite (HA) on the surface of various implant materials with good mechanical strength and corrosion resistance.

The coating is a frame structure of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) in a collagen matrix, which is formed by layer-by-layer solidification of an aqueous dispersion of SWCNT with collagen during spin coating and controlled irradiation with IR radiation. Quantum mechanical method SCC DFTB, with a self-consistent charge, was used. It is based on the density functional theory and the tight-binding approximation. The method established the optimal temperature and time for the formation of the equilibrium configurations of the SWCNT/collagen type II complexes to ensure maximum binding energies between the nanotube and the collagen. The highest binding energies were observed in complexes with SWCNT nanometer diameter in comparison with subnanometer SWCNT. The coating had a porous structure-pore size was 0.5-6 μm. The process of reducing the mass and volume of the coating with the initial biodegradation of collagen after contact with blood plasma was demonstrated. This is proved by exceeding the intensity of the SWCNT peaks G and D after contact with the blood serum in the Raman spectrum and by decreasing the intensity of the main collagen bands in the SWCNT/collagen complex frame coating. The number of pores and their size increased to 20 μm. The modification of the PET tape with the SWCNT/collagen coating allowed to increase its hydrophilicity by 1.7 times compared to the original PET fibers and by 1.3 times compared to the collagen coating. A reduced hemolysis level of the PET tape coated with SWCNT/collagen was achieved. The SWCNT/collagen coating provided 2.2 times less hemolysis than an uncoated PET implant. MicroCT showed the effective formation of new bone and dense connective tissue around the implant. A decrease in channel diameter from 2.5 to 1.7 mm was detected at three and, especially, six months after implantation of a PET tape with SWCNT/collagen coating. MicroCT allowed us to identify areas for histological sections, which demonstrated the favorable interaction of the PET tape with the surrounding tissues. In the case of using the PET tape coated with SWCNT/collagen, more active growth of connective tissue with mature collagen fibers in the area of implantation was observed than in the case of only collagen coating. The stimulating effect of SWCNT/collagen on the formation of bone trabeculae around and inside the PET tape was evident in three and six months after implantation. Thus, a PET tape with SWCNT/collagen coating has osteoconductivity as well as a high level of hydrophilicity and hemocompatibility.","",""

Homogeneous ACP precipitation was induced in situ within the sponges by a temperature-controlled coating process composed of two steps. In the first step, the CaP solution was cooled to 4 °C to suppress precipitation until the solution penetrated fully into the sponge's internal pores. In the second step, the CaP solution was warmed up to 25 °C with continuous shaking to induce ACP precipitation within the sponges. The resulting sponges were therefore coated with ACP nanoparticles on their inner and outer surfaces. A simulated body fluid (SBF) test indicated osteoconductivity of the collagen sponges coated with ACP nanoparticles. Further, ACP-coated collagen sponges immobilizing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were fabricated using the CaP solution supplemented with bFGF.

In this work, a substrate-independent coating with on-demand release of an antifibrotic drug has been fabricated to effectively address this issue. This coating was formed through a substrate-independent layer-by-layer (LBL) technique via a cationic polyelectrolyte (poly-diallyldimethylammonium, PDDA) and an anionic polyelectrolyte (poly-styrenesulfonate, PSS), where parts of PSS and PDDA were physically replaced by carboxyl functionalized polyethylene glycol grafted onto antifibrotic drug dexamethasone (DEX-PEG-COOH). Considering the easy generation of local inflammation after implantation, an ester bond was designed between PEG-COOH and DEX. Therefore, the overexpressed esterase under inflammatory conditions hydrolyzes the ester bond and thereby releases DEX from the film to inhibit fibrosis occurring in the tissue repair process. The in vivo capacity of this coating to restrain tissue fibrosis was investigated by a skin defect model using porous polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds as substrates. The experimental results showed that the fibrosis-related proteins (Col-I, TGF-β and fibronectin) and the infiltration of myofibroblasts (α-SMA) of skin tissues in the coated PCL scaffold group were significantly lower than those in the blank control group and pure PCL scaffold group.

It was found that the population of ADSCs on the GelMA-PEGDA-RNTK scaffold increased by 34% compared to the GelMA-PEGDA scaffold (control). Moreover, after 3 weeks of chondrogenic differentiation, collagen II, glycosaminoglycan, and total collagen synthesis on the GelMA-PEGDA-RNTK scaffold significantly respectively increased by 59%, 71%, and 60%, as compared to the control scaffold. Gene expression of collagen II α1, SOX 9, and aggrecan in the ADSCs growing on the GelMA-PEGDA-RNTK scaffold increased by 79%, 52%, and 47% after 3 weeks, compared to the controls, respectively. These results indicated that RNTKs are a promising type of nanotubes for promoting chondrogenic differentiation, and the present 3D-printed three-layer gradient GelMA-PEGDA-RNTK scaffold shows considerable promise for future cartilage repair and regeneration.","",""

Polylactic acid (PLA) attracts much attention to utilize as a GBR membrane because it has relatively high mechanical strength and biodegradability. However, the poor osteoconductivity of PLA is a major concern. The aim of this study is to improve the osteoconductivity of fibrous, electrospun, PLA guided bone regeneration membranes by coating the fiber surface with highly biocompatible tantalum (Ta). Ta coating of electrospun PLA membrane was created through sputtered Ta ions surrounding the PLA fibers. The Ta-coated PLA (Ta-PLA) membranes remain a randomly aligned fibrous structure with no defects caused by sputtering. The chemical composition of Ta-PLA membrane indicates Ta coating was well deposited on PLA fibers. Although the mechanical strength of Ta-PLA was reduced compared with bare PLA membrane, the Ta coating layer does not readily delaminate from the single PLA fiber surface due to its cladded structure which indicates that the Ta coating has high mechanical stability on PLA fibers. In vitro cell tests demonstrate that the attachment, proliferation, and differentiation of preosteoblasts are significantly promoted on the Ta-PLA membranes compared to bare PLA. In an in vivo animal test, most calvarial defects in the Ta-PLA group are covered with newly formed bone within six weeks, while the defects in the bare PLA group are rarely covered. Furthermore, the degree of bone healing in the Ta-PLA group is comparable to healing observed on collagen membranes, which are highly bioactive materials. These results indicate the superior osteoconductivity of Ta-PLA will make it particularly useful as a guided bone regeneration membrane.","",""

Herein, the influence of the chemical composition of the substrate on homogeneous modification of the surface with mussel-inspired polydopamine (PDA) is focused. Accordingly, the deposition of PDA on the surface was proved by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Morphologies of the scaffolds demonstrated homogeneous decoration of the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/polyurethane (PU)-polyaniline (PANI) matrixes with PDA, while a lower density of mussel-inspired polymer was observed in bare PU-PANI constructs. Although uniform and dense precipitation of PDA reduced conductivity of scaffolds 1.2 times compared with the samples with a low density of the PDA, 1.1 and 1.2 times enhancement in tensile strength and Young's modulus, respectively, were the strength of the applied process, especially in bone tissue engineering area. Contact angle measurements demonstrated about two times reduction in measured values, which shows improvement in hydrophilicity of PDA-modified PVA/PU-PANI fibers compared with PDA-coated PU-PANI ones. Swelling ratio and mass loss ratio calculations revealed enhancement in measured values as a function of homogeneous and dense coating, which arise from hydrophilicity of the polymeric substrate. The bioactivity test indicated that a dense layer of PDA strongly supports formations of hydroxyapatite-like crystals. Moreover, homogeneous decoration of conductive matrixes with PDA showed suitable cell viability, adhesion, and spreading while cell-scaffolds interactions improved under electrical stimulation. Higher expression of alkaline phosphatase and secretion of Collagen I under the electrical field proved the applicability of modified electroconductive scaffolds for further preclinical and clinical studies to introduce as a reconstructive bone substitute.","",""

PVA is a kind of synthetic biostable polymer with high hydrophilicity in the human body, has been widely used in the biomedical field. However, the use of PVA is limited in cell cultures due to lack of biologically active functional groups. In this study, amino silane (KH-550), glutaraldehyde and native type I collagen were used to modify three-dimensional PVA scaffold to establish a suitable composite scaffold for hepatocyte culture. Three types of composite scaffolds were prepared for different collagen content, named as PVA/COL (0.2%), PVA/COL (0.5%) and PVA/COL (0.8%), respectively. The composite scaffolds were characterized by SEM, XPS, FTIR, MS, porosity estimation and water contact angle measurement. The PVA/COL (0.8%) scaffolds had the highest collagen content of 12.13%. The composite scaffold showed high porosity with interconnected pores. Furthermore, the biocompatibility between HepG2 cells and scaffolds was evaluated by the ability of cell proliferation, albumin secretion, as well as urea synthesis.

Previous research has highlighted the benefit of scaffold macroporosity in enhancing stem cell survival and bone regeneration in vivo. However, there remains a lack of injectable and in situ crosslinkable macroporous matrices for stem cell delivery to achieve fast bone regeneration in immunocompetent animal model. The goal of this study is to develop an injectable gelatin-based μRB hydrogel supporting direct cell encapsulation that is available in clinics as macroporous matrices to enhance adipose-derived stromal cell (ASC) survival, engraftment and accelerate bone formation in craniofacial defect mouse. Methods: Injectable and in situ crosslinkable gelatin microribbon (μRB)-based macroporous hydrogels were developed by wet-spinning. Injectability was optimized by varying concentration of glutaraldehyde for intracrosslinking of μRB shape, and fibrinogen coating. The efficacy of injectable μRBs to support ASCs delivery and bone regeneration were further assessed in vivo using an immunocompetent mouse cranial defect model. ASCs survival was evaluated by bioluminescent imaging and bone regeneration was assessed by micro-CT. The degradation and biocompatibility were determined by histological analysis. Results: We first optimized injectability by varying concentration of glutaraldehyde used to fix gelatin μRBs. The injectable μRB formulation were subsequently coated with fibrinogen, which allows in situ crosslinking by thrombin. Fluorescence imaging and histology showed majority of μRBs degraded by the end of 3 weeks. Injectable μRBs supported comparable level of ASC proliferation and bone regeneration as implantable prefabricated μRB controls. Adding low dosage of BMP2 (100 ng per scaffold) with ASCs substantially accelerated the speed of mineralized bone regeneration, with 90% of the bone defect refilled by week 8. Immunostaining showed M1 (pro-inflammatory) macrophages were recruited to the defect at day 3, and was replaced by M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophages by week 2. Adding μRBs or BMP2 did not alter macrophage response. Injectable µRBs supported vascularization, and BMP-2 further enhanced vascularization. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that µRB-based scaffolds enhanced ASC survival and accelerated bone regeneration after injection into critical sized cranial defect mouse. Such injectable µRB-based scaffold can provide a versatile biomaterial for delivering various stem cell types and enhancing tissue regeneration.","",""

PLGA scaffold without Medpor® was created to serve as the control. Scaffolds were vacuum-seeded with rabbit chondrocytes, freshly isolated from the ear by enzymatic digestion. Then, cell-seeded scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsal pockets of nude mice. After 12 weeks, explants were analyzed by histological, biochemical, and mechanical evaluations. Although the PLGA group resulted in neocartilage formation, the PLGA-Medpor® group demonstrated improved outcome with the formation of well-surrounded cartilage around the implants with higher mechanical strength than the PLGA group, indicating that Medpor® has an influence on the structural strength of engineered cartilage. The presence of collagen and elastin fibers was evident in the histological section in both groups.

We used this formulation in an ad hoc designed 3D printer to create regularly ordered scaffolds, which we then enriched with type IV collagen, an isoform of collagen that is exclusively found in basement membranes. Human epithelial A549 cells were then seeded on control scaffolds or on scaffolds coated with collagen, which was precipitated, or on scaffolds first collagenized and then exposed to either UVB or UVC radiation. Observations by the transmission light microscope, confocal microscope after staining with calcein-AM/propidium iodide, and by environmental scanning electron microscope revealed that collagen-enriched UV-treated scaffolds promoted the attachment of a higher number of cells, which covered a more extensive area of the scaffold, as also confirmed by alamar blue viability assay. Together these data confirm that coating 3D-printed scaffolds made of D-(+) raffinose-modified chitosan with type IV collagen and exposing them to UV light sensibly increases the cell compatibility of scaffolds, making them a better candidate to serve as a tool for the regeneration of epithelia.","",""

Therefore, here we determined how microscale 3D collagen I presentation and fibroblast interaction affect the longevity of PHHs. High-throughput droplet microfluidics was utilized to generate reproducibly sized (∼300-μm diameter) microtissues containing PHHs encapsulated in collagen I ± supportive fibroblasts, namely, 3T3-J2 murine embryonic fibroblasts or primary human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs); self-assembled spheroids and bulk collagen gels (macrogels) containing PHHs served as controls. Hepatic functions and gene expression were subsequently measured for up to 6 weeks. We found that microtissues placed within multiwell plates rescued PHH functions at 2- to 30-fold higher levels than spheroids or macrogels. Further coating of PHH microtissues with 3T3-J2s led to higher hepatic functions than when the two cell types were either coencapsulated together or when HSCs were used for the coating instead. Importantly, the 3T3-J2-coated PHH microtissues displayed 6+ weeks of relatively stable hepatic gene expression and function at levels similar to freshly thawed PHHs. Lastly, microtissues responded in a clinically relevant manner to drug-mediated cytochrome P450 induction or hepatotoxicity.

The response of these cells to the biomaterial depends both on the local microenvironment and on the characteristics of the inserted bone substitute. In this work, bone allografts impregnated with albumin are loaded with a co-culture of human MSCs and monocytes; bone granules without albumin are used for comparison. Co-cultures are contextually treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines to simulate the inflammatory milieu naturally present during the bone regeneration process. As revealed by microscopic images, albumin-impregnated bone granules promote adhesion and interactions between cells populations. Compared to control granules, albumin coating diminishes reactive species production by cells. This reduced oxidative stress may be attributable to antioxidant properties of albumin, and it is also reflected in the mitigated gene expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes, where most intracellular reactive molecules are generated. MSCs-monocytes co-cultured onto albumin-impregnated bone granules additionally release higher amounts of immunomodulatory cytokines and growth factors. In summary, this work demonstrates that impregnation of bone granules with albumin positively modulates the interactions between MSCs and immune cells, consequently influencing their mutual activities and immunomodulatory functions.","",""

When administered to a rat subcutaneous site, the CNT-coated nanofiber exhibited significantly reduced inflammatory signs (down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and macrophages gathering). Moreover, the CNT-coated nanofibers showed substantially promoted angiogenic responses, with enhanced neoblood vessel formation and angiogenic marker expression. Such stimulated tissue healing events by the CNT interfacing were evidenced in a calvarium bone defect model. The in vivo bone regeneration of the CNT- coated nanofibers was significantly accelerated, with higher bone mineral density and up-regulated osteogenic signs (OPN, OCN, BMP2) of in vivo bone forming cells. The in vitro studies using MSCs could demonstrate accelerated adhesion and osteogenic differentiation and mineralization, supporting the osteo-promoting mechanism behind the in vivo bone forming event. These findings highlight that the CNTs interfacing of biopolymer nanofibers is highly effective in reducing inflammation, promoting angiogenesis, and driving adhesion and osteogenesis of MSCs, which eventually orchestrate to accelerate tissue healing and bone regeneration process.

Instead of discovering new biomaterial candidates, we synthesized hyaluronic acid-catechol (HACA) conjugates to establish a versatile hyaluronic acid coating platform named ""NiCHE (nature-inspired catechol-conjugated hyaluronic acid environment)"" for boosting the salivary gland tissue engineering efficacy of the previously reported biomaterials. By mimicking hyaluronic acid-rich niche in the mesenchyme of embryonic submandibular glands (eSMGs) with NiCHE coating on substrates including polycarbonate membrane, stiff agarose hydrogel, and polycaprolactone scaffold, we observed significantly enhanced cell adhesion, vascular endothelial and progenitor cell proliferation, and branching of in vitro-cultured eSMGs. High mechanical stiffness of the substrate is known to inhibit eSMG growth, but the NiCHE coating significantly reduced such stiffness-induced negative effects, leading to successful differentiation of progenitor cells to functional acinar and myoepithelial cells. These enhancement effects of the NiCHE coating were due to the increased proliferation of vascular endothelial cells via interaction between CD44 and surface-immobilized HAs. As such, our NiCHE coating platform renders any kind of material highly effective for salivary gland tissue culture by mimicking in vivo embryonic mesenchymal HA. Based on our results, we expect the NiCHE coating to expand the range of biomaterial candidates for salivary glands and other branching epithelial organs.","",""

After 17 hr, pre-osteoblast density on SLBs without or with RGD was similar, but lower than on PLL. Cell surface area, elongation, and number and size of phospho-paxillin clusters were also similar. Cells on SLBs without or with RGD were smaller, more elongated, and had less and smaller phospho-paxillin clusters than on PLL. OPN expression was increased on SLBs with RGD compared to PLL.

In this study, hydrophobic plastic was coated with the mussel adhesive protein Mefp-1 as well as with other cell adhesives (poly-lysine, fibronectin, and collagen). Human keratinocytes and chondrocytes were seeded on these substrates at 37°C in culture medium, followed by analysis of attachment and proliferation by crystal violet staining and metabolic labelling. Performance of Mefp-1 and fibrin as tissue glues were estimated by tensional force resistance measurement of moist porcine dermis (as a correlate to scaffold) glued to dermis, cartilage, or bone at 37°C. Mefp-1 supported maximal cell attachment at a coating density of approximately 1 µg/cm2. This was at least as good as the other adhesives tested. In addition, it supported cell proliferation at least as good as regular tissue culture plastic over a 7-day period. Measurement of tensional force resistance showed that Mefp-1 performed equally well as fibrin when porcine dermis was glued to cartilage and bone at the same concentration. Separation of the moist tissues after 15-minute incubation required a force of approximately 1 N/cm2 for both compounds. Mefp-1 show properties that qualify it as a compound that potentially could replace fibrin as a tissue glue for scaffold fixation.

Although the mechanism underlying the action of Lf in bone cells is still not fully elucidated, it has been shown that its mode of action leading to the survival of osteoblasts is complemented by its mitogenic effect. Activation of several signalling pathways and gene expression, in an LRPdependent or independent manner, has been identified.

Nowadays, various techniques have been developed for the applications of SF in bioengineering. Most of the literature reviews focus on the SF-based biomaterials and their different forms of applications such as films, hydrogels, and scaffolds. SF is also valuable as a coating on other substrate materials for biomedicine; however, there are few reviews related to SF-coated biomaterials. Thus, in this review, we focused on the surface modification of biomaterials using SF coatings, demonstrated their various preparation methods on substrate materials, and introduced the latest procedures. The diverse applications of SF coatings for biomedicine are discussed, including bone, ligament, skin, mucosa, and nerve regeneration, and dental implant surface modification. SF coating is conducive to inducing cell adhesion and migration, promoting hydroxyapatite (HA) deposition and matrix mineralization, and inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway, making it a promising strategy for bone regeneration. In addition, SF-coated composite scaffolds can be considered prospective candidates for ligament regeneration after injury. SF coating has been proven to enhance the mechanical properties of the substrate material, and render integral stability to the dressing material during the regeneration of skin and mucosa. Moreover, SF coating is a potential strategy to accelerate nerve regeneration due to its dielectric properties, mechanical flexibility, and angiogenesis promotion effect. In addition, SF coating is an effective and popular means for dental implant surface modification to promote osteogenesis around implants made of different materials. Thus, this review can be of great benefit for further improvements in SF-coated biomaterials, and will undoubtedly contribute to clinical transformation in the future.","",""

A total of 10,697 references were iden-tified and 26 were included to analyze 1,109 implants, with follow-ups from 2 to 84 weeks. The ARRIVE guidelines and the SYRCLE tool were used to evaluate the methodology and scientific evidence. A meta-analysis was performed (RevMan 2020 software, Cochane Collaboration) with random effects that evaluated BIC at 4 weeks, with subgroups for the different coatings. The heterogeneity of the pooled studies was very high (95% CI, I2 = 99%). The subgroup of BMPs was the most favorable to coating. Surface modification of Ti implants by organic bioactive molecules seems to favor osseointegration in the early stages of healing, but long-term studies are necessary to corroborate the results of the experimental studies.","",""
