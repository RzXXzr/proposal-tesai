The cell viability was evaluated with CCK-8 kit after 1, 5, 7, and 9 days. The deposition of calcified matrix and the expression of osteogenesis-related genes were evaluated by Alizarin Red staining and real-time PCR after incubation in osteogenic medium for 21 days. The expression of inflammation-related genes in cells was determined after exposure to 1 μg/mL LPS for 3 h. Finally, the numbers of cells that migrated through the permeable membranes were compared during 15 h. Propolis and MTA significantly increased the viability of hDPCscompared to the control group on days 7 and 9. In the propolis group, significant enhancement of osteogenic potential and suppressed expression of IL-1β and IL-6 was observed after LPS exposure compared to the MTA and control groups. The number of migration cells in the propolis group was similar to that of the control group, while MTA significantly promoted cell migration. Propolis showed comparable cell viability to that of MTA and exhibited significantly higher anti-inflammatory and mineralization promotion effects on hDPCs.","",""

Wistar rats were randomly assigned into six groups having six animals in every group. Thioacetamide (200 mg/kg) was administered orally three times per week, whereas propolis at three different doses (100, 150 and 200 mg/kg) was administered three times per week alternatively to thioacetamide for continuous eight weeks. Hematology, serology, tissue biochemistry, and histology were carried out to assess thioacetamide induced fibrosis and hepatic injury as well as recovery pattern due to propolis. Five major compounds present in propolis were subjected to molecular docking analysis. Propolis decreased serological activity of AST, ALT, ALP, γ-GT, cholesterol, HDL, TG, bilirubin, triglycerides and increased level of albumin, glucose, and LDL. Propolis protected tissues from oxidative stress induced by thioacetamide in terms of LPO. Hydroxyproline, a marker of liver fibrosis was restored by propolis treatment toward control. Level of SOD, catalase, GSH, GR, GPx, GST, G6PDH in liver were upshifted in propolis treated groups. Molecular docking analysis interpreted interaction of phytochemicals present in propolis in ameliorating effects and role in preventing liver fibrosis. In vivo and in silico analysis concluded that propolis has hepatoprotective activity by reducing thioacetamide induced liver fibrosis in rats.","",""

Although the efficacy in skin wound healing has been documented, the specific mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which propolis facilitates wound healing and improves ulcer treatment. Specifically, we investigated the impact of Brazilian green propolis and its primary bioactive compound, artepillin C (ARC), on cell behavior and collagen metabolism in human dermal fibroblasts. In vitro culture models were used to evaluate the effects of propolis and ARC on fibroblast proliferation, migration, differentiation into myofibroblasts, collagen fibril formation, and collagen gel contraction. Treatment with propolis increased extracellular deposition of type I and V collagen while reducing extracellular type III collagen, without affecting collagen mRNA expressions or Smad2 activation, a critical transcription factor known to regulate collagen synthesis. Additionally, propolis reduced the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, enzymes for collagen degradation, and simultaneously elevated tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2, which inhibits MMPs activity. Propolis treatment also restricted collagen gel contraction, fibroblast migration, and differentiation into myofibroblasts. Furthermore, propolis suppressed the activation of signaling pathways involving Akt, NF-κB, p38, and ERK, known regulators of collagen metabolism and apoptosis resistance. Some of these biological effects of propolis were replicated by ARC. Our findings suggest that Brazilian green propolis and ARC facilitate wound healing and may enhance ulcer treatment by modulating collagen metabolism and regulating fibroblast behavior.","",""

A comprehensive evaluation of microstructural and biological properties of the produced scaffolds was conducted. The fabricated scaffolds exhibited high porosity (49-60%) with interconnected pores and compressive strength (1.2-1.8 MPa), closely resembling cancellous bone and indicating suitability for bone regeneration. They were biocompatible, promoted osteoblast adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, and supported apatite deposition on their surfaces, demonstrating strong bioactivity and potential for implant osseointegration. Importantly, the scaffolds did not trigger excessive production of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, suggesting a low risk of inflammatory responses. Additionally, CAPE-enriched scaffolds inhibited biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, reducing the risk of implant-associated infections. In summary, these CAPE-modified scaffolds integrate optimal microstructural and biological features, such as reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting biofilm formation, and thus offer a promising strategy for enhancing bone repair and regeneration in clinical applications.","",""

Propolis, a natural bioactive compound, is proposed to modulate glucose and lipid metabolism and exert anti-inflammatory effects. However, previous reviews have limited scope, and the effects of propolis on T2DM remain debated, particularly concerning lipid profiles, glycemic control, inflammation, and oxidative stress. A systematic search was conducted across Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, SinoMed, Wanfang Data, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, with the search time limit set from the establishment of the databases to 20 May 2025. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool version 2 (ROB 2); evidence quality was evaluated via the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach; and meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4. In total, 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 731 participants were included in this study. Propolis supplementation significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (mean difference (MD) = 0.13, 95% CI 0.10-0.16, p < 0.00001), and reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (MD = -0.32, 95% CI: -0.56 to -0.08; p = 0.009) and triglyceride (TG) levels (MD = -0.15, 95% CI: -0.30 to -0.01; p = 0.04). It also improved glycemic control, lowering fasting blood sugar (FBS) (MD = -1.13, 95% CI: -2.00 to -0.27, p = 0.01), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (MD = -0.95, 95% CI: -1.36 to -0.55, p < 0.00001), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (MD = -0.44, 95% CI: -0.78 to -0.11, p = 0.01). Furthermore, propolis significantly reduced C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD = -2.68, 95% CI: -3.48 to -1.89, p < 0.00001). However, no significant effects were observed for total cholesterol (TC), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), superoxide dismutase (SOD), or malondialdehyde (MDA).

The extract's anti-ulcer activity was evaluated using acidified ethanol-induced gastric ulcers and pylorus ligation to assess gastric antisecretory activity. Additionally, the study examined histological, oxidative, and inflammatory parameters, and the extract's anti-Helicobacter pylori and cytotoxic effects. The 100 mg/kg oral dose of HeBPA promoted gastroprotection by 69.63% by increasing antioxidant defenses (GSH, CAT, and SOD) and reducing MPO activity and MDA levels in ulcerated mucosa. This gastroprotective effect was not due to antisecretory activity, but rather involved non-protein sulfhydryl compounds, alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide, as evidenced by the abolition of the effect with L-NAME, NEM, indomethacin, or yohimbine pre-treatment. HeBPA increased mucin stained by PAS in the gastric mucosa and prevented histological damage, reducing edema and inflammatory infiltrate. Additionally, HeBPA promoted fibroblast proliferation at 1 µg/mL, but showed no antibacterial activity against H. pylori (MIC > 1000 µg/mL).

The objective is to evaluate temporal variations, quantify correlations between the terms, and explore how external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have influenced public and clinical interest in these topics. Search data were extracted, normalized, and analyzed using multivariate time series methods, including vector autoregression (VAR) modeling, Impulse Response Function (IRF) analysis, and forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD). Stability, causality, and inter-period relationships were assessed using statistical analysis, with results visualized through time series plots and impulse response coefficients. Results: Key findings reveal significant interdependencies between search terms, with surges in one often resulting in immediate or short-term increases in others. Notable trends include a marked increase in COVID-19 interest for nanosilver, propolis, and antibacterial, followed by a return to baseline levels, while antimicrobial maintained a sustained upward trajectory. Biomaterials experienced initial declines but later stabilized at elevated levels. Conclusions: These findings underscore the oscillating nature of public interest in antimicrobial and biomaterial innovations, highlighting opportunities for targeted research and commercialization. By adapting future material development to emerging trends and clinical needs, dentistry can use these insights to develop infection control strategies, improve restorative materials, and deal with persistent challenges such as antimicrobial resistance, peri-implantitis, and tooth caries treatment.","",""

Phytochemical screening was conducted to determine the presence of bioactive compounds, such as ascorbic acid, saponins, and tannins. Antioxidant activity was evaluated using the phosphomolybdate (PMA) and ferric reducing power (FRP) assays. The antibacterial efficacy against Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus was assessed using the well diffusion method. Cytotoxicity and anticancer effects were investigated using the MTT assay on red blood cells (RBCs) and various carcinoma cell lines (HepG2, MDA, and A549). Gene expression analysis was performed using RT-qPCR to assess the upregulation of immune response genes (P53, Bcl2, Bax, Ca125, and C3). Phytochemical screening revealed considerable quantities of ascorbic acid, saponins, and tannins in the propolis samples. The P1 sample exhibited the most substantial antioxidant activity, with FRP values at 62.9 mg/g DM and PMA content at 20.7 mg/g DM. In antibacterial assays, P1 demonstrated the highest inhibitory zones at the maximum concentration (400 mg/ml), outperforming standard antibiotic treatments. In cytotoxicity and anticancer assays, P1 preserved the highest percentage of RBCs from hemolysis and showed marked anticancer activity, with the lowest cell viability observed at 3.9 µg/ml. Gene expression analysis revealed significant upregulation of immune response genes, particularly in MDA and HepG2 cell lines upon P1 treatment. This study underscores the potent antioxidant, antibacterial, and anticancer properties of propolis, highlighting its potential as a natural therapeutic agent. The observed activities suggest promising applications for propolis in combating bacterial infections and various cancer types, warranting further exploration into its molecular mechanisms and potential clinical uses.","",""

This study investigated the biological properties of a combined barberry root and propolis extract (PBE) in comparison to a propolis extract (PE), a barberry root extract (BE), and pure berberine (BN). Methods: The antioxidant properties were evaluated using DPPH and FRAP methods and total phenolic contents (TPC) were assessed by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. HPTLC was used to quantify the BE in the tested samples. Their effect on HEK293T cells was monitored in real-time by using the xCELLigence system which recorded changes in the proliferative activity (PA). The metabolic activity (MA) was evaluated using an MTS test and cell migration was analyzed via a scratch assay. Results: The PE exhibited a higher TPC (198.67 mg/g) than the BE (119.3 mg/g). The PBE exhibited a comparable antioxidant effect to that of the PE. In the cell assays, the PE, the BE, and BN significantly reduced the proliferative activity at higher concentrations (p < 0.0001) while the PBE demonstrated a lower cytotoxicity and proved to be safer for the tested cells. The highest IC50 value was determined for the PBE (130 µg/mL), suggesting that this combination has a reduced cytotoxicity. However, the scratch test did not confirm a significant supportive effect of the PBE on cell migration. Conclusions: Although the PBE did not show enhanced antioxidant properties, it may mitigate cytotoxicity and support proliferation at lower concentrations. This suggests that extraction of raw propolis with a previously prepared barberry extract results in a safer preparation, but its therapeutic potential requires further studies using biological models.","",""

Although previous studies have evaluated the antimicrobial effects of propolis in dentistry, its effects on dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) viability, migration, and differentiation are yet not well understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Chinese propolis on viability/proliferation, migration, differentiation and cytokine expression in DPSCs. Commercially available DPSCs (Lonza) were treated with aqueous extract of propolis (AEP) or ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP), and viability/proliferation was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays and quantification of nuclear staining. DPSC differentiation into mineralizing cells was evaluated with Alizarin red staining and cell migration was assessed using Boyden Chamber Transwell inserts. Cytokine expression was measured by RT-qPCR. AEP and EEP at 0.03 and 0.1 mg/mL did not affect DPSC viability/proliferation for up to 7-days treatment. Higher doses (0.33-33 mg/mL) induced a dose dependent decrease in DPSC viability/proliferation with a more prominent effect with EEP at 7 days. Neither AEP nor EEP induced DPSC differentiation into mineralizing cells, but both AEP and EEP (0.03-0.1 mg/ml) induced a dose dependent increase in DPSC migration. In addition, EEP prevents the upregulation of IL1b and IL6 but not IL8 and CCL2 in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. AEP has less potent anti-inflammatory effects and prevents only IL1b upregulation. This study provides new information about the biologic properties of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of propolis and shows that propolis, at doses that do not affect cell viability, induces DPSC migration and has anti-inflammatory properties. These data highlight the potential use of propolis as an alternative intra-canal medicament for regenerative endodontic procedures.","",""

As one of the treatment routes of rheumatoid arthritis is based on the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the use of natural products with anti-inflammatory potential becomes relevant. Brown propolis has several biological properties, including immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, the present study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of the crude extract of brown propolis from Araucaria sp. through experimental models of analgesia, anti-inflammatory activity, and rheumatoid arthritis. Hyperalgesia was evaluated by mechanical and thermal sensitivity. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by plantar volume, cell migration and NF-kB expression in carrageenan-induced paw oedema. In collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis, it was evaluated by mechanical and thermal nociception on the plantar surface, and mechanical nociception in the femorotibial and caudal joints, evaluation of plantar volume, radiography, weight gain and biochemical profile. The results demonstrated that the oral administration of brown propolis can modulate the course of rheumatoid arthritis, and it can inhibit pain through the modulation of mechanical sensitivity. The anti-arthritic effect of propolis may be due to its anti-inflammatory capacity, which includes inhibiting oedema formation, cell migration, and NF-kB expression, as well as preserving joint space and normalizing urea levels. This was an animal model study. Therefore, brown propolis should be evaluated in studies of human RA to determine efficacy.","",""

Edible coatings have attracted attention as a packaging method that can prolong the shelf life of meat. The study aimed to examine the impact of a combination of Lepidium sativum mucilage (LS) coating and propolis extract (PE) on prolonging the shelf life of buffalo meat. The chemical characteristics (chemical compounds, total phenol content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidant activity, and cytotoxicity) and antimicrobial activity of the PE (disk diffusion agar, well diffusion agar, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration) were investigated. The effect of the PE on the cell wall of pathogenic bacteria was examined using a scanning electron microscope. Biological properties of LS (TPC, TFC, antioxidant activity and antimicrobial effect (pour plate method)) was investigated. Different concentrations of PE (0, 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5%) were added to the coating mixture containing LS, and their effects on extending the shelf life of buffalo meat samples stored at 4°C for 9 days were assessed. The PE included gallic acid, benzoic acid, syringic acid, 4-3 dimethoxy cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, myricetin, caffeic acid, luteolin, chlorogenic acid, and apigenin. The PE was determined to have a TPC of 36.67 ± 0.57 mg GAE/g and a TFC of 48.02 ± 0.65 mg QE/g. The extract's radical scavenging activity ranged from 0 to 76.22% for DPPH radicals and from 0 to 50.31% for ABTS radicals. The viability of C115 HeLa cell was observed to be 94.14 μg/mL. The PE and LS, exhibited strong antimicrobial properties against pathogenic bacteria. The LS was determined to have a TPC of 15.23 ± 0.43 mg GAE/g and a TFC of 11.51± 0.61 mg QE/g. The LS was determined to have a DPPH of 429.65 ± 1.28 μg/mL and a ABTS of 403.59 ± 1.46 μg/mL. The microbiological analysis revealed that the LS+2.5%PE treatment was the most effective in inhibiting the growth of total viable count (6.23 vs. 8.00 log CFU/g), psychrotrophic bacteria count (3.71 vs. 4.73 log CFU/g), coliforms count (2.78 vs. 3.70 log CFU/g), and fungi count (2.39 vs. 3.93 log CFU/g) compared to the control sample. The addition of PE to the edible coating also demonstrated a concentration-dependent effect on preserving the moisture, pH, color, and hardness of the buffalo meat. Sensory evaluation results suggested that incorporating PE into the edible coating extended the shelf life of buffalo meat by three days. In the second stage of this paper, this investigation employed two distinct forecasting methodologies: the Radial Basis Function (RBF) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict a range of quality indicators for coated meat products. Upon comparison, the RBF model exhibited a higher level of accuracy, showcasing its exceptional capacity to closely match the experimental outcomes. Therefore, this type of food coating, renowned for its strong antimicrobial properties, has the potential to effectively package and preserve perishable and delicate food items, such as meat.","",""

Lower extremity wounds under diabetic conditions display a significant delay during the healing process. To overcome these challenges, the utilization of protein-based nanocomposite dressings is crucial in implementing a successful regenerative medicine approach. These dressings hold significant potential as polymer scaffolds, allowing them to mimic the properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM). So, the objective of this study was to develop a nanocomposite film using dialdehyde-xanthan gum/soy protein isolate incorporated with propolis (PP) and halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) (DXG-SPI/PP/HNTs). In this protein-polysaccharide hybrid system, the self-healing capability was demonstrated through Schiff bonds, providing a favorable environment for cell encapsulation in the field of tissue engineering. To improve the properties of the DXG-SPI film, the incorporation of polyphenols found in PP, particularly flavonoids, is proposed. The synthesized films were subjected to investigations regarding degradation, degree of swelling, and mechanical characteristics. Additionally, halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) were introduced into the DXG-SPI/PP nanocomposite films as a reinforcing filler with varying concentrations of 3 %, 5 %, and 7 % by weight. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis confirmed the proper embedding and dispersion of HNTs onto the DXG-SPI/PP nanocomposite films, leading to functional interfacial interactions. The structure and crystallinity of the synthesized nanocomposite films were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Moreover, the developed DXG-SPI/PP/HNTs nanocomposite films significantly improved cell growth of NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells in the presence of PP and HNTs, indicating their cytocompatibility. The antibacterial activity of the nanocomposite was evaluated against Escherichia coli (E. Coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. Aureus), which are commonly associated with wound infections. Overall, our findings suggest that the synthesis of DXG-SPI/PP/HNTs nanocomposite scaffolds holds great promise as a clinically relevant biomaterial and exhibits strong potential for numerous challenging biomedical applications.","",""

However, NC has no bactericidal activity, which is a critical need for the effective prevention of infections in chronic diabetic wound dressing applications.

The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed well-impregnated cellulose fibers and a more compact structure with the addition of PE. According to the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the samples containing PE underwent thermal degradation before the unmodified NC due to the presence of volatile compounds in the extract. However, the peak degradation temperature in the first derivative thermogravimetric curves was higher for all the sponges containing PE when compared to the unmodified NC.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the safety and chemopreventive potential of BBP. The cytotoxicity attributed to BBP was assessed using two different assays, while the Salmonella/microsome assay was employed to evaluate mutagenicity. The acute toxicity attributed to BBP was determined using a zebrafish model, while the chemopreventive potential was investigated utilizing Chinese hamster lung (V79) cell lines. Data demonstrated that BBP exerted cytotoxic effects at concentrations greater than or equal to 10 µg/ml and did not exhibit mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. However, at the highest concentration tested (4000 µg/plate), BBP induced a significant increase in revertant colonies in S. typhimurium TA102 strain. The LC50 equivalent to 8.83 mg/L was obtained in the acute toxicity evaluation in zebrafish. BBP also showed antigenotoxic effect by significantly reducing chromosomal damage induced by the mutagen doxorubicin in V79 cell cultures at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml. Compared to Brazilian green and red propolis, BBP exhibited greater toxicity. On the other hand, at lower concentrations, BBP displayed chemopreventive potential, which may be associated with the antioxidant capacity of the extract. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the biological properties and potential applications of BBP in treating various diseases.","",""

The current research is the first study on the biological properties of ethanolic extracts of propolis (EEP) from several different regions (12) of Iran. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC) of Iranian EEPs were variable between 26.59-221.38 mg GAE/g EEP and 4.8-100.03 mg QE/g EEP. The DPPH scavenging assay showed all the studied EEP samples, except for the sample with the lowest TPC and TFC (P6), have suitable antioxidant activity. All the EEPs inhibited both cholinesterase enzymes (acetylcholinesterase: AChE, butyrylcholinesterase: BuChE) but most of them exhibited a distinct selectivity over BuChE. Evaluation of the antibacterial activity of the EEP samples using four pathogenic bacteria (B. cereus, S. aureus, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa) demonstrated that the antibacterial properties of propolis are more effective on the gram-positive bacterium. Spearman correlation analysis showed a strong positive correlation between TPC and TFC of the Iranian EEPs and their antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antibacterial activities. Considering that there is ample evidence of anticholinesterase activity of flavonoids and a significant correlation between the anticholinesterase activity of the studied Iranian EEPs and their total flavonoid content was observed, the interaction of 17 well-known propolis flavonoids with AChE and BuChE was explored using molecular docking. The results indicated that all the flavonoids interact with the active site gorge of both enzymes with high affinity. Summing up, the obtained results suggest that Iranian propolis possesses great potential for further studies.","",""

However, to manipulate their various chemical and physical properties and create high-efficiency hydrogels, different materials have been used in their structure. Eggshell membrane (ESM) and propolis are two nature-derived materials that could be used to improve the various characteristics of hydrogels, especially structural and biological properties. Hence, the main purpose of this study is the development of a new type of GelMA hydrogel containing ESM and propolis, for use in regenerative medicine. In this regard, in this study, after synthesizing GelMA, the fragmented ESM fibers were added to it and the GM/EMF hydrogel was made using a photoinitiator and visible light irradiation. Finally, GM/EMF/P hydrogels were prepared by incubating GM/EMF hydrogels in the propolis solution for 24 h. After various structural, chemical, and biological characterizations, it was found that the hydrogels obtained in this study offer improved morphological, hydrophilic, thermal, mechanical, and biological properties. The developed GM/EMF/P hydrogel presented more porosity with smaller and interconnected pores compared to the other hydrogels. GM/EMF hydrogels due to possessing EMF showed compressive strength up to 25.95 ± 1.69 KPa, which is more than the compressive strength provided by GM hydrogels (24.550 ± 4.3 KPa). Also, GM/EMF/P hydrogel offered the best compressive strength (44.65 ± 3.48) due to the presence of both EMF and propolis. GM scaffold with a contact angle of about 65.41 ± 2.199 θ showed more hydrophobicity compared to GM/EMF (28.67 ± 1.58 θ), and GM/EMF/P (26.24 ± 0.73 θ) hydrogels. Also, the higher swelling percentage of GM/EMF/P hydrogels (343.197 ± 42.79) indicated the high capacity of this hydrogel to retain more water than other scaffolds. Regarding the biocompatibility of the fabricated structures, MTT assay results showed that GM/EMF/P hydrogel significantly (p-value < 0.05) supported cell viability. Based on the results, it seems that GM/EMF/P hydrogel could be a promising biomaterial candidate for use in various fields of regenerative medicine.","",""

Hence, response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to investigate the variation of the scaffold characteristics including porosity, average diameter, wettability, release, and tensile strength. For each response, a second-order polynomial model with a high coefficient of determination (R2) values ranging from 0.95 to 0.989 was developed using multiple linear regression analysis. The overall optimum region with the best characteristics was found to be at PCL/6 % PRP and PVA/5 % PRP. After selecting the optimal samples, the cytotoxicity assay showed no toxicity for the optimal concentrations of PRP. Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra revealed that no new chemical functional groups were introduced in the PENs. Uniform fibers were found in the optimum samples without the appearance of a bead-like structure in the fibers. In conclusion, nanofibers containing the optimal concentration of PRP with suitable properties can be used in biomedical and tissue engineering.","",""

The raw propolis was extracted via maceration with ultrasonic pretreatment in 100% water and 20% ethanol. The yield of ethanolic propolis extracts was about 1% higher than its aqueous counterpart. The colorimetric assays showed that the ethanolic propolis extract had about two times higher phenolics (17.043 mg GAE/g) and tannins (5.411 mg GAE/g), and four times higher flavonoids (0.83 mg QE/g). The higher phenolic content had enhanced the antiradical and antibacterial capacities of the ethanolic extract. The propolis extracts significantly exhibited higher antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) than gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). However, aqueous extract was found to have a higher anticancer property based on the viability of lung cancer cells. No cytotoxic effect was observed on normal lung cells as the cell viability was maintained >50%, even the concentration of propolis extracts were increased up to 800 µg/mL. Different chemical compositions of propolis extract would show different bioactivities depending upon the individual applications. The high content of phenolics suggests that the propolis extract could be a natural source of bioactive ingredients for the development of innovative and functional foods.","",""

SPE inhibited the protein denaturation by 79% to 100%, and autumn showed the highest inhibitory activity. SPE stabilized erythrocyte membrane against heat-induced and hypotonicity-induced hemolysis in a concentration-dependent manner.

Treatment is mainly based on chemotherapeutic drugs that, when used in targeted therapies, have serious side effects. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a drug commonly used against colorectal cancer (CRC), despite its side effects. Combination of this compound with natural products is a promising source in cancer treatment research. In recent years, propolis has become the subject of intense pharmacological and chemical studies linked to its diverse biological properties. With a complex composition rich in phenolic compounds, propolis is described as showing positive or synergistic interactions with several chemotherapeutic drugs. The present work evaluated the in vitro cytotoxic activity of the most representative propolis types, such as green, red and brown propolis, in combination with chemotherapeutic or CNS drugs on HT-29 colon cancer cell lines. The phenolic composition of the propolis samples was evaluated by LC-DAD-ESI/MSn analysis. According to the type of propolis, the composition varied; green propolis was rich in terpenic phenolic acids and red propolis in polyprenylated benzophenones and isoflavonoids, while brown propolis was composed mainly of flavonoids and phenylpropanoids. Generally, for all propolis types, the results demonstrated that combing propolis with 5-FU and fluphenazine successfully enhances the in vitro cytotoxic activity. For green propolis, the combination demonstrated an enhancement of the in vitro cytotoxic effect compared to green propolis alone, at all concentrations, while for brown propolis, the combination in the concentration of 100 μg/mL gave a lower number of viable cells, even when compared with 5-FU or fluphenazine alone. The same was observed for the red propolis combination, but with a higher reduction in cell viability.

The high content of epicatechin, catechin, pinobanksin, myricetin, and acids: vanillic and syringic in propolis samples was confirmed by chromatographic analysis. Moreover, the presence of caffeic acid phenethyl ester was confirmed in all samples. The origin of propolis also influenced the biological properties of its extracts. The propolis extracts were characterized by moderate DPPH free radical scavenging activity (29.22-35.14%), and relatively low ferrous iron chelating activity (9.33-32.32%).

The determination of the chemical composition and characterization of propolis samples was achieved using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), -high-performance liquid chromatography-evaporative light scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Three major triterpenes were isolated and identified using HRESI-MS and 1H/13C NMR techniques. The spectral studies confirmed the presence of compounds such as isomangiferolic acid, 27-hydoxymangiferonic acid, and 27-hydroxyisomangiferolic acid. All crude propolis samples, isolated fractions, and pure compounds demonstrated moderate antitrypanosomal and anticancer properties compared to control drugs. Amongst the tested compounds, 27-hydoxymangiferonic acid exhibited the highest antitrypanosomal activity at a concentration of 11.6 µg/mL. The highest anticancer effect was demonstrated by the Ph-2 fraction, followed by 27-hydroxyisomangiferolic acid, with IC50 values of 129.6 and 153.3 µg/mL.

Propolis has a relevant role in increasing the social immunity of bee hives. Experimental evidence indicates that propolis and its components have activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Mechanisms of action on bacteria, fungi, and viruses are known for several propolis components. Experiments have shown that propolis may act synergistically with antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirus drugs, permitting the administration of lower doses of drugs and higher antimicrobial effects. The current trend of growing resistance of microbial pathogens to the available drugs has encouraged the introduction of propolis in therapy against infectious diseases. Because propolis composition is widely variable, standardized propolis extracts have been produced. Successful clinical trials have included propolis extracts as medicine in dentistry and as an adjuvant in the treatment of patients against COVID-19. Present world health conditions encourage initiatives toward the spread of the niche of propolis, not only as traditional and alternative medicine but also as a relevant protagonist in anti-infectious therapy.

Modern research investigating the diversity of the chemical composition and plant sources, biological activity, extraction processes, analytical methods, and therapeutic properties in clinical settings have been carried out extensively since the 1980s. Due to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and immuno-modulator properties, propolis appears to be a suitable bioactive component to be incorporated into biomaterials. This review article attempts to analyze the potential application of propolis as a biomaterial component from the available experimental evidence. The efficacy and compabitility of propolis depend upon factors, such as types of extracts and types of biomaterials. Generally, propolis appears to be compatible with hydroxyapatite/calcium phosphate-based biomaterials. Propolis enhances the antimicrobial properties of the resulting composite materials while improving the physicochemical properties. Furthermore, propolis is also compatible with wound/skin dressing biomaterials. Propolis improves the wound healing properties of the biomaterials with no negative effects on the physicochemical properties of the composite biomaterials. However, the effect of propolis on the glass-based biomaterials cannot be generalized. Depending on the concentration, types of extract, and geographical sources of the propolis, the effect on the glass biomaterials can either be an improvement or detrimental in terms of mechanical properties such as compressive strength and shear bond strength. In conclusion, two of the more consistent impacts of propolis across these different types of biomaterials are the enhancement of the antimicrobial and the immune-modulator/anti-inflammatory properties resulting from the combination of propolis and the biomaterials.","",""

Studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of propolis extracts and its major bioactive compound caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) on obesity and diabetes. Herein, CAPE was found to have pharmacological activity against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in diet-induced obese mice. CAPE, previously reported as an inhibitor of bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH), inhibited BSH enzymatic activity in the gut microbiota when administered to mice. Upon BSH inhibition by CAPE, levels of tauro-β-muricholic acid were increased in the intestine and selectively suppressed intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling. This resulted in lowering of the ceramides in the intestine that resulted from increased diet-induced obesity. Elevated intestinal ceramides are transported to the liver where they promoted fat production. Lowering FXR signaling was also accompanied by increased GLP-1 secretion. In support of this pathway, the therapeutic effects of CAPE on NAFLD were absent in intestinal FXR-deficient mice, and supplementation of mice with C16-ceramide significantly exacerbated hepatic steatosis. Treatment of mice with an antibiotic cocktail to deplete BSH-producing bacteria also abrogated the therapeutic activity of CAPE against NAFLD. These findings demonstrate that CAPE ameliorates obesity-related steatosis at least partly through the gut microbiota-bile acid-FXR pathway via inhibiting bacterial BSH activity and suggests that propolis enriched with CAPE might serve as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of NAFLD.","",""

Many scientific publications were retrieved from the Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases via searching the word ""propolis"". The different extraction procedures, key biologically active compounds, biological properties, and therapeutic potential of propolis were analyzed. It was concluded that propolis possesses a variety of biological properties because of a very complex chemical composition that mainly depends on the plant species visited by bees and species of bees. Numerous studies found versatile pharmacological activities of propolis: antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, etc. In this review, the composition and biological activities of propolis are presented from a point of view of the origin and standardization of propolis for the purpose of the development of new pharmaceutical products on its base. It was revealed that some types of propolis, especially European propolis, contain flavonoids and phenolic acids, which could be markers for the standardization and quality evaluation of propolis and its preparations. One more focus of this paper was the overview of microorganisms' sensitivity to propolis for further development of antimicrobial and antioxidant products for the treatment of various infectious diseases with an emphasis on the illnesses of the oral cavity. It was established that the antimicrobial activity of different types of propolis is quite significant, especially to Gram-negative bacteria and lipophilic viruses. The present study could be also of interest to the pharmaceutical industry as a review for the appropriate design of standardized propolis preparations such as mouthwashes, toothpastes, oral drops, sprays, creams, ointments, suppositories, tablets, and capsules, etc. Moreover, propolis could be regarded as a source for the isolation of biologically active substances. Furthermore, this review can facilitate partially overcoming the problem of the standardization of propolis preparations, which is a principal obstacle to the broader use of propolis in the pharmaceutical industry. Finally, this study could be of interest in the area of the food industry for the development of nutritionally well-balanced products. The results of this review indicate that propolis deserves to be better studied for its promising therapeutic effects from the point of view of the connection of its chemical composition with the locality of its collection, vegetation, appropriate extraction methods, and standardization.","",""

Several chromatographic techniques have been applied to characterize propolis, highlighting the extraction of its volatiles and its analysis through gas chromatography. Fourteen Brazilian propolis samples collected in four states, including brown, green and red propolis types, were chemically characterized using the automated direct thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (DTD-GC-MS). Red propolis type was characterized by acyclic saturated hydrocarbons, fatty alcohols, terpenes, and phenylpropanoids as nonacosane, α-copaene, β-amyrin acetate, anethole, and 7-O-methylvestitol. Brown propolis presented hydrocarbons, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes, as α-pinene and α-bisabolol. Brazilian green propolis presented polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and sesquiterpenes, including 1-methyl-octahydroanthracene, 2,5-dimethyl-γ-oxo-benzenebutanoic acid, nerolidol, and spathulenol. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, allowing for clustering brown and red propolis types, indicating a divergence with the chemical composition of the green propolis samples. The hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) allowed the chemical fingerprint of each propolis type to be differentiated. Red propolis was characterized by sesquiterpenes, pterocarpans, and isoflavans; brown propolis was characterized by hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and monoterpenes, while green propolis samples were characterized by the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenes, and naphthalene derivatives. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.","",""

Significant cytotoxic effects were observed after 24 h of treatment via microscopic and flow cytometric analysis, where a morphological change toward late apoptosis was observed. By contrast, honey had low antioxidant activity and no antiproliferative effect in MCF-7 cells. The water-soluble propolis also exerted its antiproliferative effect in the human keratinocyte HaCaT cell line. The antiproliferative activity was similar (P>0.05) at 24 and 48 h of treatment, with IC50 at 2.7±0.06 mg/ml and <0.4 mg/ml, respectively.

Propolis is considered safe and biocompatible. Yet due to its intrinsic complexity, standardization of propolis preparations for medical use as well as prediction of e.g. pathogen-specific interactions becomes a non-trivial task. In this work we demonstrate a new physical mechanism of propolis action, largely independent of specific nuances of propolis chemistry, which may underlie some of its biological actions. We show that propolis-bearing surfaces generate an extensive exclusion zone (EZ) water layer. EZ is an interfacial region of water capable of excluding solutes ranging from ions to microorganisms. Propolis-generated EZ may constitute an effective barrier, physically disabling the approach of various pathogens to the propolis-functionalized surfaces. We suggest possible implications of this new mechanism for propolis-based prevention of respiratory infections.","",""

In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of CAPE against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced SH-SY5Y cells. The neuroprotective effects were detected by using cell viability, Annexin V, Hoechst staining, total caspase activity, cell cycle, as well as western blotting. Besides, the anti-oxidative activity was measured by the production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial function was determined by measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). We found that CAPE significantly increased cell viability and decreased apoptotic cell death (~20%) after 150 μM 6-OHDA exposure following 24 h. 1.25 μM CAPE also prevented 6-OHDA-induced changes in condensed nuclear morphology. Furthermore, treatment with 1.25 μM CAPE increased mitochondrial membrane potential in 6-OHDA-exposed cells.

Additionally, forty volatile compounds were identified by means of headspace-solid phase microextraction with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry time of flight analysis (HS-SPME/GC-MS-TOF). The main volatile compounds detected include nonanal (18.82%), α-pinene (12.45%), neryl alcohol (10.13%), and α-pinene (8.04%). EEP showed an anti-proliferative effect on glioma cells better than temozolomide, also decreased proliferation and viability in cervical cancer cells, but its effectiveness was lower compared to cisplatin.","",""

A major 4-phenyl coumarin named cinnamoyloxy-mammeisin (CNM) isolated from stingless bee geopropolis showed interesting biological properties; however, its antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus has never been investigated. In order to clarify these properties, CNM isolated from geopropolis was initially tested against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus strains. Further, the effects of CNM were assessed on the microbial adherence to human cells, biofilm formation and mature biofilm. Then, the acute toxicity of the compound was determined in Galleria mellonella. CNM showed bacteriostatic activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus strains, with MIC of 11.3 μM. In addition, CNM at 5.7 μM reduced bacterial adherence to human keratinocytes from 1 to 3 h and disrupted biofilm formation by reducing cell viability and architecture, as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy. The acute toxicity assay indicated no significant harmful effects. Based on these findings, CNM can be considered a promising compound with anti-S. aureus properties and predicted low toxicity. Thus, it may be used as a drug candidate or lead compound for structure/activity optimization.","",""

Our results showed that BOP has strong anti-inflammatory effects and acts by reducing nuclear factor κB activation, tumor necrosis factor α release, and neutrophil migration. In addition, BOP6 exhibited antifungal activity on planktonic and biofilm cultures of Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, and Candida parapsisolis and reduced in vitro yeast cell adhesion to human keratinocytes at sub-inhibitory concentrations. BOP demonstrated significantly low toxicity in Galleria melonella larvae at antifungal doses. Lastly, a chemical analysis revealed the presence of caffeoyltartaric acid, 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid, quercetin, and gibberellins A7, A9, and A20, which may be responsible for the biological properties observed. Thus, our data indicate that BOP is a promising source of anti-inflammatory and antifungal molecules that may be used as a functional food.","",""

Considering that people living with HIV/aids (PLWHA) on effective combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) present early aging due to an intense immune activation, inflammation, and redox imbalance, propolis consumption could offer a benefit to such patients. This double-blind longitudinal study evaluated whether Brazilian green propolis pills intake (500 mg/day for three months) would decrease the oxidative stress of virological suppressed HIV-individuals. To compare each group (propolis, n = 20 versus placebo, n = 20) in both moments (M0, before and M1, after the intervention), the following markers were assessed: plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonylation, total oxide nitric, total antioxidant capacity (TAP), superoxide dismutase, catalase, and NFkB and NRF2 gene expression. Data were analyzed using Poisson, Gamma distribution and ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer. The groups were homogeneous regarding age, gender, time of diagnosis/ treatment, cART scheme, CD4+ T cell count, and no changes were observed in the diet food, or patients' lifestyles. A decreased MDA concentration was seen in the propolis group (M0 = 0.24 ± 0.13, M1 = 0.20 ± 0.10 protein nmol/mg; p = 0.005) as well as a slight but non-significant increase of TAP (M0 = 49.07 ± 13.26, M1 = 52.27 ± 14.86%; p = 0.06). One may conclude that propolis promoted a lower lipid peroxidation and improved the antioxidant system, suggesting that its use may be beneficial to PLWHA in an attempt to contain the intense inflammatory and oxidant activity.","",""

However, although many countries produce honey, another bee product, the consumption of propolis as a functional ingredient is linked to hydroethanolic extract. Hence, other food uses of propolis still have to be incorporated into food systems. Assuming that propolis is a rich source of flavonoids and is regarded as a food-grade ingredient for food and pharmaceutical applications, this review provides a theoretical and practical basis for optimising the bioactive properties of Brazilian propolis, encompassing the extraction processes and incorporating its bioactive compounds in the delivery systems for food applications. Overall, pharmacotechnical resources can optimise the extraction and enhance the chemical stability of phenolic compounds to ensure the bioactivity of food formulations.","",""
