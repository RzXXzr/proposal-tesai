A titanium implant was placed six weeks after the extraction of tooth 22. Alveolar augmentation was performed using synthetic xenograft material in combination with a collagen membrane. Seven months later, a provisional restoration was delivered, followed by the placement of a definitive screw-retained crown 120 days afterward. No complications were reported throughout the treatment, and the patient consistently maintained excellent oral hygiene. This case underscores the feasibility of implant therapy in immunocompromised patients, despite longstanding concerns regarding the potential negative impact of immunosuppressive agents on bone metabolism and healing. Treatment success relied on a thorough medical history review, precise planning, minimally invasive surgical techniques, and the use of specific postoperative medications. Regular follow-up visits and diligent oral hygiene were also key to the favorable outcome. While this individual case was successful, further clinical studies are needed to establish comprehensive guidelines for implant treatment in patients with autoimmune conditions or organ transplants who are receiving immunosuppressive and systemic anti-inflammatory therapy.","",""

However, long-term tooth loss in the posterior mandible often leads to rapid absorption of both buccal and lingual trabecular bone plates and subsequent atrophy of the alveolar ridge. This ultimately results in horizontal bone deficiencies that complicate achieving an optimal three-dimensional placement for dental implants. Conventional techniques employed clinically for horizontal bone augmentation have limited efficacy, cause significant surgical trauma, and require extended treatment duration. Consequently, the selection of an effective and minimally invasive bone augmentation technique for restoring bone width is an essential prerequisite for successful implant restoration in the posterior mandible. This clinical case study presented a treatment approach involving guided bone regeneration (GBR) and in situ Onlay grafting for bone level augmentation in the blade-shaped alveolar ridge of the posterior mandible, followed by implant restoration. By rotating the in situ sourced bone block, the denser bone volume at the base of the blade-shaped alveolar ridge was transferred to the crest of the alveolar ridge, obviating the necessity for a secondary operative site and mitigating complications such as pain, edema, sensory abnormalities, and nerve injury. Incorporation of trabecular bone within the recipient area enhanced fixation while augmenting vascular supply. A significant increase in bone volume by 1,628.21 mm3 was achieved within 7 months postoperatively. Overall, this novel approach offers valuable insights into minimally invasive and stable techniques for alveolar bone augmentation.","",""

In one patient, the implant placement was associated with the guided bone regeneration (GBR) technique. This serious complication has been widely described in the literature, especially in the anterior mandible area. In cases of bone resorption, the edentulous ridge becomes closer to the artery, and the risk of vessel injury increases. In both patients, the hematoma rapidly spread in the loose tissues of the mouth floor, displacing the tongue posteriorly and cranially, with airway compromise. The patients were hospitalized with nasotracheal intubation to secure the airway. In both patients, the bleeding stopped spontaneously, and after a few days, the oral floor swallowing was reduced, allowing the endotracheal tube to be removed. In about 2 weeks, the hematoma completely resorbed without surgery. According to the literature, the main cause of floor of the mouth hemorrhage is the mandibular lingual cortical plate perforation during bone drilling with subsequent sublingual-submental artery injury. In fact, in the first patient presented, this surgical error was clearly noticeable on the CT scan. Differently, in the second case reported, no radiological signs of inner cortical perforation were observed, and together with a mouth floor hematoma, a blood collection was also evident on the lower lip, suggesting a different cause of bleeding. Most likely during the periosteal release incision, mandatory in GBR technique, the ascending mental artery was injured, and hematoma spread in the mouth floor through the similar incision done on the lingual flap. Firstly, the mouth floor hemorrhage caused by an injury of a vestibular soft tissue artery during GBR surgery was reported. Strategies and recommendations to avoid this life-threatening event are provided, based on the literature review and the authors' experience.","",""

The initial assessment included a panoramic radiograph revealing marginal bone loss and an enlarged peri-implant space, necessitating implant removal. Following implant removal and provisional restoration, the patient was re-evaluated for subsequent therapeutic treatments. The patient underwent orthodontic treatment to improve mesio-distal spacing, followed by surgical intervention involving GBR and simultaneous implant placement. The GBR procedure utilised bone substitutes and resorbable membranes, with soft tissue augmentation conducted subsequently. The surgical intervention involved local anaesthesia, flap design, defect assessment, and palatally oriented implant placement. GBR was then performed. After six months, implant uncovering and soft tissue augmentation were conducted. The implant was loaded with a screwed restoration following complete hard and soft tissue healing. The patient was monitored every six months for two years, then annually. At the 10-year follow-up, no signs of bone resorption or soft tissue inflammation were observed.

In the case of an untreated OAC, oro-antral fistula develops and becomes epithelialized. We aimed to introduce a treatment for OAC closure via a sinus bone grafting procedure using bone tacks and a collagen membrane with an allograft. The procedure was performed by applying an absorbable membrane made in pouch form. This membrane acted as a barrier for closing the large sinus membrane perforation. Bone tacks were used to fix the membranes. Subsequently, the maxillary sinus was filled with the allograft, and the absorbable membrane was reapplied. Primary closure was achieved by performing a periosteum-releasing incision for a tension-free suture. After 6 months, sufficient bone dimensions were gained without any occurrence of maxillary sinusitis or recurrence of OAC. Additional bone grafts and implantation could be performed to rehabilitate the maxillary posterior area. We conclude that this technique might be a useful treatment for reconstructing the maxillary posterior area with simultaneous sinus bone graft and OAC closure.","",""

As the use of bee products for health purposes grows in apitherapy (a branch of alternative medicine), raising public awareness of their potential risks is essential. This narrative review synthesises the clinical manifestations of HBP allergy, culprit allergens present in each product, immunological mechanisms, diagnostic approaches, at-risk populations, and knowledge gaps. The analysis of the available literature suggests that, although relatively rarely, HPB may trigger allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock. The sensitisation mechanism may be associated with both primary sensitisation and cross-reactivity and can be classified into type I (IgE-mediated) and type IV (T-cell-mediated). However, bee bread appears less allergenic than other HBPs, potentially due to lactic fermentation that can degrade allergenic proteins. Severe reactions following intake of bee bread have not been reported to date. Management of HBP allergic reactions centres on avoiding the products, educating about the risks, and providing more precise product labelling, specifying the allergen content. Individuals with atopy and beekeepers are at heightened risk of developing anaphylaxis; therefore, they should be particularly aware of the potential dangerous consequences of HPB use. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms of HBP allergies and improve safety for all users.","",""

Common marker families include flavonoids (pinocembrin, chrysin, galangin), phenolic esters (CAPE, benzyl/allyl caffeates), prenylated cinnamates like artepillin C, lignans, and volatile terpenoids or benzenoids. Rapid screening by ATR-FTIR and NMR is often complemented with LC-MS for confirmatory quantitation. Propolis quality control is moving toward harmonized workflows combining FTIR/NMR/HPTLC screening with LC-MS verification and optional elemental or volatile profiling, paving the way for shared marker sets and international standards similar to those for honey.","",""

This systematic review compared Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) and the Shell Technique (ST) for vertical bone gain (VBG), bone quality, complications, patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), and implant survival. Methods: Following PRISMA 2020 and PROSPERO registration (CRD420251128502), PubMed and Scopus databases were searched. Adults requiring VRA before implants were included. Interventions were GBR using titanium-reinforced dense PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) or collagen membranes and ST using autogenous or allogeneic cortical plates. Results: Both techniques achieved clinically meaningful vertical augmentation. Median VBG was 4.24 mm for GBR (range 2.20-8.78 mm) and 5.16 mm for ST (range 3.10-7.60 mm) at re-entry (typically 4-9 months). Long-term series showed maintained gains for ST up to 10 years and multi-year stability after GBR in selected cohorts. Major early-healing complications were uncommon with both methods. Minor soft-tissue events varied; several GBR cohorts reported more exposures/dehiscence and occasional infections. Implant survival was uniformly high; validated PROMs were seldom reported. Conclusions: GBR and ST both enable vertical reconstruction sufficient for implant placement. ST tended toward higher median VBG but requires greater technical expertise and, when autogenous, adds donor-site morbidity; allogeneic shells reduce harvesting needs. GBR remains a versatile, donor-site-sparing alternative. Standardized outcome (including validated PROMs) reporting and head-to-head randomized trials are needed to refine case selection and confirm comparative effectiveness.","",""

Advances in three-dimensional (3D) printing now enable preparation of patient-specific biodegradable scaffolds designed using 3D imaging, like cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and computer-aided design (CAD), allowing precise replication of defect geometry and tailored biological performance. This review article summarizes the most recent preclinical and clinical studies investigating biodegradable 3D printed scaffolds for alveolar bone regeneration. Studies were searched in the PubMed database, Scopus, and Google Scholar with the most relevant keywords related to 3D printed scaffolds focusing on alveolar bone regeneration. Polymers such as PLA, PCL, and PLGA offer mechanical stability and printability but require bioactive modification. Ceramics, including hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate, provide osteoconductivity yet are brittle. Hydrogels such as gelatin and alginate support cellular viability but lack structural strength. Composite scaffolds integrating polymers with ceramics or bioactive agents demonstrated superior osteogenic potential. Clinical applications included alveolar ridge preservation, guided bone regeneration, cleft repair, and implant site reconstruction. Emerging strategies utilizing bioinks with stem cells and growth factors further enhanced the biological properties of patient-specific 3D printed scaffolds for clinical purposes. 3D printed patient-specific biodegradable scaffolds represent a promising alternative to conventional grafting, offering precise defect reconstruction, improved biological integration, and translational potential in maxillofacial surgery.

During hydrolysis, α-TCP releases calcium (Ca²⁺) and phosphate (PO₄³⁻) ions that actively promote tissue mineralization, making it particularly valuable for applications in periodontal bone repair, periapical lesion treatment, and dental hard tissue remineralization. However, while α-TCP demonstrates excellent initial osteogenic activity, its rapid degradation kinetics in physiological environments often lead to premature structural collapse, localized hyperphosphatemia, and inconsistent bone formation outcomes. This review examines the current applications of α-TCP in oral medicine, with particular focus on its clinical use in apexification, alveolar ridge preservation, and guided bone regeneration. We critically analyse the material's limitations, including its mechanical instability in load-bearing sites and unpredictable resorption profiles that may hinder long-term regenerative outcomes. Emerging strategies to overcome these challenges are discussed, such as the development of composite systems combining α-TCP with β-TCP, hydroxyapatite, or biodegradable polymers to achieve optimized degradation rates and enhanced mechanical performance. Furthermore, we explore innovative approaches in material design, including surface functionalization with bioactive molecules and the fabrication of three-dimensional printed (3D-printed) α-TCP scaffolds with controlled porosity.

Based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, nine randomized clinical trials published before 2024 were selected for analysis, all of them investigating the application of osteoplastic materials. Six studies performed xenogenic bone augmentation; one of them compared alloplastic and xenogenic materials; two studies described synthetic osteoplastic materials; and one described autogenic bone material. Socket augmentation with osteoplastic materials demonstrates effectiveness in preserving alveolar ridge dimensions and creating favorable conditions for further implant placement, though differences in clinical performance highlight the need for careful material selection.","",""

A systematic review without meta-analysis (CRD42020165512) was conducted and reported using SWiM framework to analyze studies until January 2025. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) and reference lists were searched. Inclusion criteria targeted clinical studies (randomized trials or non-randomized cohort and case-control studies) that involved any kind of surgical interventions on patients with endodontic-periodontal lesions. The primary outcomes used to assess treatment efficacy were clinical attachment level, probing pocket depth and radiography findings. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 and the ROBINS-I tools. The GRADE framework was used to assess the certainty of evidence. A total of 13 studies, including 6 randomized controlled trials and 7 non-randomized studies, were reviewed to evaluate non-surgical versus combined surgical and non-surgical approaches, timing of interventions, intraoperative materials, intracanal medicaments, single versus combined surgical techniques, and follow-up protocols. Surgical interventions combined with non-surgical treatment yielded better clinical outcomes than non-surgical treatment alone. Within surgical strategies, earlier intervention, use of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) instead of resorbable collagen membrane, and intracanal medicament replacement appeared beneficial. However, titanium-prepared PRF showed no added advantage over PRF, and the combining multiple surgical types was not necessarily more effective. Most studies showed moderate to serious risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence was low to very low. Current limited evidence suggests that surgical intervention may be beneficial in managing endodontic-periodontal lesions, particularly when preceded by non-surgical treatment. Surgical treatment may help preserve teeth affected by endodontic-periodontal lesions, although current evidence shows highly individualized treatment strategies.","",""

Evidence from studies on species such as Nile tilapia, rainbow trout, European sea bass, meagre and African catfish indicates that dietary supplementation with bee products can improve growth performance, immune and antioxidant responses, stress tolerance and resistance to bacterial infections while, in some cases, enhancing the nutritional value and shelf-life of fish products. Prominent examples include ~45% higher growth in African catfish with 10-30 g kg-1 bee pollen, up to 93% protection in Nile tilapia fed 25 g kg-1 pollen against Aeromonas hydrophila, and increased trout fillet carotenoids with pollen-derived pigments (with overall growth unchanged and pigmentation lower than synthetic astaxanthin).

This review aims to explore cellular interactions between alveolar bone regenerative cells and GBR/GTR membranes, membrane design strategies based on biological functions, and advancements in material engineering to overcome current clinical challenges. A comprehensive search strategy was implemented across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science databases, as well as clinical trials registers. Data pertinent to membrane synthetic methodology, biological behavior, tissue regeneration outcomes were retrieved from the original studies. A qualitative assessment was performed. Overall, ideal GBR/GTR membranes must meet several functional requirements: (i) Clinical necessities include biocompatibility, selective permeability for nutrient exchange, and clinical operability. GTR aims to create and maintain a stable isolated space to protect blood clots, thereby enabling blood clots and the newly formed tissue to effectively block the migration of epithelial cells. GBR demands rigid space maintenance to resist mucosal compression in edentulous ridges, with greater emphasis on mechanical stability for large bone defects. Degradation kinetics must align with slower bone formation (3-6 months). (ii) Appropriate surface properties (roughness, morphology, stiffness, wettability, charge) and porosity/pore size are critical for cell behavior. (iii) Membrane-based biological regulation can promote cell adhesion and migration, and balance osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis. Optimization strategies include incorporating bioactive substances for bone regeneration, immunomodulatory agents for anti-inflammatory responses, and antibacterial additives for clinical performance. GBR/GTR membranes require multifunctional integration of barrier functionality, tailored biodegradation, mechanical robustness, and proactive bioactivity (osteogenic, angiogenic, immunomodulatory, and antibacterial). Future designs must prioritize understanding cell-material interactions to develop membranes that dynamically synchronize with the regenerative microenvironment. This review provides a foundation for developing next-generation membranes that effectively address complex oral microenvironment challenges and significantly improve clinical outcomes in bone defect reconstruction. Optimized membranes will enhance space maintenance, reduce infection rates, mitigate premature degradation, and improve predictability in reconstructing periodontal and alveolar bone defects, ultimately advancing regenerative outcomes in implant dentistry and periodontal surgery.","",""

The conversion of WAT into brown adipose tissue (BAT) enhances energy expenditure and improves metabolic health. Propolis, natural resinous substance produced by honeybees, contains bioactive compounds such as caffeic acid phenethylester, chrysin and quercetin, which are thought to regulate adipogenesis and promote WAT browning. This systematic review aimed to synthesize preclinical evidence on the molecular mechanisms by which propolis and its bioactive compounds regulate adipogenesis, lipid metabolism and the browning of white adipose tissue. We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar, without time restrictions, using relevant keywords related to propolis and obesity. A total of 7 preclinical studies (animal and in vitro) met the inclusion criteria. These studies indicate that propolis and its bioactive compounds, modulate adipogenic transcription factors, reduce lipid accumulation and increase expression of browning markers in cellular and animal models. Studies in vivo demonstrate reductions in body weight, fat accumulation and adipocyte differentiation, accompanied by increased thermogenesis. Preclinical evidence suggests that propolis modulates adipogenesis, lipid metabolism and WAT browning; however, clinical trials assessing mechanistic endpoints are lacking and necessary before translational recommendations can be made.","",""

To address these limitations and expand the chemical space of this natural scaffold, extensive synthetic efforts have focused on generating structurally diverse chrysin derivatives that possess improved drug-like properties. This review systematically categorizes synthetic methodologies-such as etherification, esterification, transition-metal-mediated couplings, sigmatropic rearrangements, and electrophilic substitutions-and integrates them with corresponding biological outcomes. Particular emphasis is placed on recent (2020-present) advances that directly link structural modifications with pharmacological enhancements, thereby offering comparative structure-activity relationship (SAR) insights. In addition, transition-metal-catalyzed C-C bond-forming reactions are highlighted in a dedicated section, underscoring their growing role in accessing bioactive chrysin analogs previously unattainable by conventional chemistry. Unlike prior reviews that mainly summarized biological activities or broadly covered flavonoid scaffolds, this article bridges synthetic diversification with pharmacological evaluation. It provides both critical synthesis and mechanistic interpretation.

A literature search was conducted using four electronic databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and cohort studies involving adult patients undergoing molar tooth/teeth extraction planned for implant placement and with a minimum follow-up of 3 months were included. Data on horizontal and vertical ridge dimension changes, need for GBR or SFA for implant placement and other implant-related outcomes were collected. A total of 14 studies were included: eight RCTs, two CCTs, three prospective cohort studies, and one retrospective cohort study. 571 sites were analyzed, with the number of sites in individual studies ranging from 20 to 80. In periodontally sound sockets, the ridge width reduction was less in the ARP groups (range: -1.02 ± 0.88 mm to -2.73 ± 1.68 mm) compared to SH groups (range: -2.36 ± 0.91 mm to -4.44 ± 3.71 mm). A similar trend was noted for ridge height reduction, irrespective of the condition of extraction socket. Moreover, ARP reduced the need for advanced grafting procedures (20.8% for ARP groups vs 47.7% for SH groups), including GBR, SFA and SFA via lateral window approach.

Prebiotics, such as resistant starch, have been shown to lower uremic toxins and reduce inflammation, while dietary adjustments, including low-protein and gluten-free diets, modulate microbial diversity and improve renal biomarkers. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which stabilizes creatinine levels and shifts gut microbiota toward beneficial taxa, represents another promising approach. However, limitations persist: synbiotics, which often induce gut microbiota shifts, frequently lack clinical impact; probiotics, which enhance glucose control and oxidative stress mitigation, exhibit variable efficacy; and interventions such as propolis or cranberry extract, which have been tested, prove ineffective.

Propolis can be directly added to food, used as an edible coating, or incorporated into packaging. However, its composition varies by region, and its use is restricted in many countries due to allergenic concerns. Research is ongoing to optimize its safety and composition, aiming to establish propolis as a sustainable solution for natural food preservation.

These include herbal remedies (e.g., Panax ginseng), fungi (e.g., Ganoderma lucidum), and animal-derived substances (e.g., propolis from Apis mellifera). Despite their popularity, the safety profiles of these products-particularly concerning adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)-remain insufficiently understood. This study aimed to assess the safety profiles of adaptogenic and immunomodulatory natural products through a scoping review of published human studies and an analysis of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) from the WHO-UMC VigiBase database. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using PubMed (1980-2024) in line with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Eligible studies included randomized and non-randomized clinical trials and case reports in humans focused on safety outcomes. Data extraction followed the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) standardized template. ICSRs from VigiBase were analyzed by product type, AE type and seriousness, and demographic characteristics. The data were further organized to highlight the 15 most frequently reported products and their top five System Organ Classes (SOCs) and Preferred Terms (PTs). Results: The scoping review identified 51 natural products with reported adaptogenic and/or immunomodulatory properties. This included 285 clinical trials and 119 case studies on single-ingredient products and 54 clinical trials and 21 case studies on multi-ingredient preparations. Common AEs included gastrointestinal, dermatological, hepatic, cardiovascular, and immunological reactions. SAEs were rare but reported for Echinacea purpurea, Silybum marianum, and Camellia sinensis. From Vigibase, 45,042 ICSRs were retrieved for 49 natural products: 10,702 for single-ingredient and 34,340 for multi-ingredient products. Among 7856 reports listing a single-ingredient product as the sole suspect, 15.8% were SAEs, including eight fatal cases. However, the causality remained unclear due to insufficient data. Ganoderma lucidum, Viscum album, and Silybum marianum were most frequently associated with SAEs. In multi-ingredient products, propolis was frequently linked to hypersensitivity and skin reactions. Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive overview of the safety profiles of adaptogenic and immunomodulatory natural products. Variability in product composition, lack of standardization, incomplete reporting in clinical studies, and underreporting in pharmacovigilance databases complicate accurate risk assessment. For multi-ingredient products, attributing specific AEs to specific components remains difficult. Further high-quality clinical research and improved pharmacovigilance are needed, along with clear safety warnings to reduce risks for consumers.","",""

One representative flavonoid is chrysin, a compound found in honey, propolis, and passionflower (Passiflora spp.). Chrysin exhibits a range of biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective, and anxiolytic effects. Its biological activity is primarily attributed to the presence of hydroxyl groups, which facilitate the neutralization of free radicals and the modulation of intracellular signaling pathways. Cellular uptake of chrysin and other flavonoids occurs mainly through passive diffusion; however, certain forms may be transported via specific membrane-associated carrier proteins.

These constituents confer broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Mechanistically, propolis exerts antibacterial effects through multiple pathways: inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, disrupting membrane integrity (causing ion leakage and ATP depletion), and blocking nucleic acid synthesis by targeting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase II. It also inhibits biofilm formation. Flavonoids interfere with bacterial enzymes and DNA synthesis, while artepillin C modulates inflammatory pathways, such as NF-κB, reducing prostaglandin and nitric oxide production. Propolis demonstrates synergistic effects with conventional antibiotics, enhancing their efficacy against drug-resistant strains by increasing membrane permeability and inhibiting resistance enzymes.

Customized titanium mesh (CTM), designed using CAD/CAM or 3D printing, offers a precise fit and may reduce surgical risks. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare CTM and TM in terms of bone gain and complication rates in vertical ridge augmentation procedures. A systematic search was carried out in four electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) up to January 2025, with no time restrictions applied. Studies comparing customized titanium mesh (CTM) and conventional titanium mesh (TM) for vertical ridge augmentation were considered eligible if they included at least 10 patients and a minimum follow-up period of 6 months. The primary outcomes were vertical and horizontal bone gain, as well as membrane exposure. Meta-analyses and meta-regressions were performed using R software. A total of 22 studies were included in the analysis (3 randomized controlled trials, 6 prospective studies, 12 retrospective studies, and 1 cohort study), comprising 608 patients and 1,318 implants. The mean vertical bone gain was 6.24 mm for the TM group and 5.14 mm for the CTM group, with no statistically significant difference between them (P = 0.628). In contrast, CTM achieved significantly greater horizontal bone gain (6.38 mm vs. 3.85 mm; P = 0.004). Membrane exposure occurred more frequently in the TM group (30.9%) than in the CTM group (20.3%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.721). Other complications, such as infections, were also more common in the TM group but did not show statistical significance. Within the limitations of the included studies, CTM appears to offer comparable bone gain to TM, with superior horizontal bone gain and a tendency to fewer complications. The results support the potential advantages of customized mesh in clinical practice. Further randomized trials with standardized protocols and long-term follow-up are recommended to confirm these findings.","",""

Nearly three decades ago, Professor Robert Marx demonstrated that PRP-obtained via centrifugation of whole blood with anti-coagulants-could accelerate healing across a wide range of indications in both dentistry and medicine. Subsequent research showed that eliminating anti-coagulants, leading to the development of PRF, resulted in an even more natural and faster healing process.

Aquafaba, a vegan alternative to egg white, is produced from chickpeas and has various culinary applications. Coffee silver skin, a by-product of coffee production, contains bioactive compounds that can be extracted and used in functional foods. Propolis, a resinous substance collected by bees, is rich in bioactive compounds with health benefits. Wine lees, a by-product of winemaking, can be processed to extract phenolic compounds and produce value-added products. Avocado waste valorisation focuses on converting avocado by-products into valuable products for various industries. The sustainable valorisation of food waste offers numerous benefits, such as reducing waste output, generating revenue and promoting resource efficiency. Collaboration between stakeholders is essential to advance research and implement sustainable management practices for food waste valorisation to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Challenges such as scaling-up, regulatory frameworks, logistics, food safety and environmental impact must be addressed to effectively valorise food waste.","",""

However, increasing interest in complementary and integrative therapies has led to the exploration of topical herbal treatments as potential alternatives or adjuncts in managing this condition. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with Cochrane guidelines and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations, with prior registration. A comprehensive search of Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed from inception to June 17, 2024. After screening 7,386 nonduplicate records and assessing 346 full-text articles, 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) encompassing 1,250 patients were included. Data were extracted regarding intervention types, outcomes, and adverse events, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Results: The included studies evaluated topical formulations of lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.), olive leaf extract (Olea europaea L.), propolis, and a combined sage-rhubarb cream (Salvia officinalis L., Rheum palmatum L., and Rheum officinale Baill.). Lemon balm preparations consistently reduced pain intensity and swelling, with some studies also reporting a significant decrease in lesion size compared with placebo or acyclovir. Olive leaf extract demonstrated a statistically significant faster improvement in symptoms and a shorter healing time compared with acyclovir. Compared with acyclovir, propolis formulations significantly shortened the median time to lesion encrustation and complete healing compared with acyclovir, and the combined sage-rhubarb cream showed a comparable efficacy to acyclovir in mean healing time. Overall, the risk of bias was judged to be low in two trials, while five trials raised some concerns. The total sample size across studies was small, potentially limiting the generalizability of the results. Across all studies, adverse events were minimal or absent. Discussion: The findings indicate that topical herbal therapies may provide effective and well-tolerated alternatives or adjuncts to conventional antiviral treatments for herpes labialis. However, considerable heterogeneity in intervention protocols and outcome measures, as well as the underrepresentation of pediatric populations, limit the generalizability of these findings. Conclusion: Topical herbal interventions, including lemon balm, olive leaf extract, propolis, and sage-rhubarb formulations, demonstrate potential benefits in managing herpes labialis with favorable safety profiles.

This review focuses on the antimicrobial mechanisms of honey, including its efficacy against resistant bacteria, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antimicrobial action of honey is multifactorial, involving hydrogen peroxide production, phenolic compounds, high sugar concentrations, and the presence of bee defensin-1. The composition of honey varies based on its floral source, which can influence its antimicrobial strength. Certain types, such as Manuka honey, are particularly effective in clinical applications due to their higher levels of bioactive compounds. Honey has also been shown to disrupt bacterial biofilms, a major factor in antibiotic resistance, enhancing its therapeutic potential in treating chronic wounds and infections, especially in patients with compromised immune systems. Moreover, honey's ability to improve wound healing, reduce inflammation, and promote tissue regeneration highlights its broad therapeutic profile. As antibiotic resistance continues to challenge modern healthcare, honey offers a promising complementary treatment in antimicrobial therapy. Research into its specific bioactive components and potential synergistic effects with other natural agents, like ginger and propolis, could expand its applications. Standardizing honey products for medical use and establishing clinical guidelines are essential for optimizing its therapeutic benefits. As scientific understanding of honey's antimicrobial mechanisms deepens, its integration into healthcare systems as an adjunct therapy is expected to increase, offering a natural and effective alternative in the fight against infectious diseases.","",""

Successful replantation of the tooth depends on various factors such as the time between the event and replantation, as well as the extra-alveolar storage medium and duration. The adoption of the correct handling measures and use of an appropriate storage medium are key factors that affect the long-term prognosis of the avulsed tooth following replantation. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to determine if Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) is the most effective storage medium to preserve periodontal (PDL) cell viability following avulsion. Methods: A comprehensive review of the literature available was conducted on the 18 November 2024 across three databases, namely EBSCO (including PubMed-Medline), Scopus, and Web of Science. The review was written according to and following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement created in 2009 and updated in 2020. The following PICO question was constructed for the systematic review: ""In patients with avulsed permanent teeth, is Hank's balanced salt solution more effective in preserving periodontal cell viability to increase the likelihood of a more successful replantation than any other storage media technique available?"" A meta-analysis was also conducted with the selected studies, and the software used for this was R 4.3.1 (R Core Team (2018)). Results: A total number of 443 articles were found in the initial search. Of these 443, 9 articles were included in the final systematic review and meta-analysis. 6 out of the 9 articles conclude HBSS to be the most superior storage medium for the preservation of the PDL cells, whilst the other three concluded PDL cell preservation was higher in Morinda citrifolia juice, propolis, and coconut water, suggesting a suitable alternative to HBSS. Nonetheless, the meta-analysis indicated that PDL cell viability was significantly higher using HBSS compared to all other storage media.

Random-effects pairwise meta-analyses were used to compare changes in vertical (height) and horizontal (width) alveolar bone dimensions between individuals exposed and unexposed to diabetes, through standardized mean differences (SMDs). Three non-randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, all of which showed a serious risk of bias. The results showed, with overall very low certainty on evidence, that individuals with diabetes did not exhibit a significant difference in horizontal (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.92-0.10) and vertical (SMD = 0.06, 95% CI: -0.43-0.56) ridge augmentation compared to the those without diabetes. The available evidence, albeit of very low certainty, suggests that diabetic individuals with moderate or good glycemic control undergoing dental implants and GBR show comparable horizontal and vertical bone gains to their unexposed counterparts. https://osf.io/bpx3t.","",""

Numerous studies have shown that propolis can help reduce gum inflammation, inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and promote tissue regeneration, but with varying degrees of success reported. For this reason, this comprehensive systematic review aims at finding out the truth concerning the efficacy of propolis mouthwashes in treating gingivitis and periodontitis, as its main objective. Research findings from 6 different databases: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), PubMed®, Europe PMC, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), BioMed Central, and Google Scholar, were retrieved and examined in addition to a manual search in the references lists. The PICOS framework was used to select and exclude studies. The focus was on clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of propolis-containing mouthwashes in comparison with propolis-free ones for the treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis, employing related periodontal indices. Animal studies, microbiological studies, in-vitro studies, retrospective studies, case-control studies, cohorts, case reports, case series, reviews, letters, editorials, meta-analyses, and non-clinical randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs), all were excluded. A meta-analysis was not performed and data were only studied qualitatively due to the obvious heterogeneity amongst the studies. Data from the selected studies were extracted, and then the revised Cochrane's risk of bias tool (RoB 2.0) was utilised by two of the authors, independently, to evaluate the risk of bias in each study. At first, 151 results were reached, but then after removing duplicates, 99 records remained, and were later screened, assessed, and studied in full details based on the set PICOS criteria. Out of these 99 articles, ten studies were included in this systematic review, encompassing a total of 453 patients with an age range of (13-70) years old. Propolis mouthwashes with different protocols of application were the intervention whereas placebo or the rest of the tested mouthwashes such as, chlorhexidine, sodium fluoride with cetylpyridinium chloride, sterile distilled water, hydrogen peroxide, were the ones to which propolis mouthwashes were compared. Treatment duration extended from 14 days to 3 months and the follow-up period differed from 14 days to 3 months. In general, propolis mouthwashes decreased plaque accumulations and gingival inflammation in gingivitis patients based on the employed indices. On the other hand, the aforementioned tested mouthwashes other than propolis were deemed equally effective or even superior to propolis in some studies. As an overall assessment for the risk of bias, four studies were assigned as having a low risk of bias. Two studies were deemed to have some concerns, while four studies were identified as having a high risk of bias. Despite the fact that propolis has shown positive effects in terms of controlling gingival and periodontal inflammation especially when used with mechanical methods, studies lack certainty and their power of evidence is low with no agreed gold standards. These conclusions come, for sure, within the limitations of this review, like having substantial variability amongst the included studies and the presence of studies with a high risk of bias. The findings demonstrate that propolis-based mouthwashes showed promising clinical outcomes in reducing plaque and gingival inflammation. However, it is highly recommended to conduct more rigorous trials with patient-reported outcome measures, extended follow-up periods, larger samples sizes, better-designed methodologies, typified propolis use, and with the implementation of similar indices in order to obtain more reliable, conclusive, and generalisable results.

In addition to innate resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, S. aureus strains resistant to methicillin (MRSA) often show resistance to other classes of antibiotics (multidrug resistance). The advancement of phage therapy against MRSA infections offers a promising alternative in the context of increasing antibiotic resistance. Therapeutic phages are easier to obtain and cheaper to produce than antibiotics. However, there is still a lack of standards to ensure the safe use of phages, including purification, dosage, means of administration, and the quantity of phages used. Some bacteria have developed defense mechanisms against phages. The use of phage cocktails or the combination of antibiotics and phages is preferred. For personalized therapy, it is essential to set up large collections to enable phage selection. In the future, the fight against MRSA strains using phages should be based on a multidisciplinary approach, including molecular biology and medicine. Other therapies in the fight against MRSA strains include the use of endolysin antimicrobial peptides (including defensins and cathelicidins). Researchers' activities also focus on the potential use of plant extracts, honey, propolis, alkaloids, and essential oils. To date, no vaccine has been approved against S. aureus strains.","",""

Propolis, a resinous product collected by bees, is renowned for its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Recent research emphasizes its positive role in osteogenesis, primarily through the modulation of osteoclast and osteoblast activity via molecular pathways. Key mechanisms include reducing inflammatory cytokines, protecting against oxidative stress, and upregulating growth factor essential for bone formation. While compounds such as Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester, Apigenin, Quercetin, and Ferulic Acid have been well-documented, emerging evidence points to the significant roles of less-studied compounds like Pinocembrin, Kaempferol, p-Coumaric acid, and Galangin. This review synthesizes the current literature, focusing on the mechanisms by which these bioactive compounds influence osteogenesis. Firstly, it explores the techniques for characterizing bioactive compounds presented in propolis, the chemogeographic variations in its composition, and the effects of both crude extracts and isolated compounds on bone tissue, offering a comprehensive analysis of recent findings across different experimental models. Further, it discusses the effects of Propolis compounds on bone health. In summary, these compounds modulate signaling pathways, including nuclear factor kappa beta, wingless-related integration site, mitogen-activated protein kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and reactive oxygen species. These pathways influence the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-β/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-β ligand/osteoprotegerin system, fostering bone cell differentiation. This regulation mitigates excessive osteoclast formation, stimulates osteoblast activity, and ultimately contributes to the restoration of bone homeostasis by maintaining a balanced bone remodeling process.","",""

In May 2023, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published its revised guidance document on the risk assessment of plant protection products (PPPs) for bees, including, beyond honey bees, other bee species from Bombus and Osmia genera. Despite the Meliponini widespread distribution in tropical and subtropical regions, the impact of pesticides on stingless bees remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a systematic review of stingless bee toxicological studies which highlights a substantial knowledge gap. Up to October of 2024, only 144 research articles on the effects of pesticides on Meliponini had been identified, 80 % of those were conducted in a single country (Brazil). The number of bee species and PPPs tested is extremely low, with just five species accounting for almost 50 % of the collected data and only 79 PPPs tested, among which biopesticides were the most common. Concerning the experimental methodologies, there is a significant lack of studies focusing on chronic exposure and field assays, as well as a scarcity of studies focusing on sublethal effects. Furthermore, we pinpoint to areas where research is needed for the development of risk assessment guidelines to protect these vital pollinators.","",""

A variety of surgical treatments are used for odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) depending on the clinical and radiographic presentation. The aim of this report and literature review is to highlight methods to treat OKC combined with guided tissue regeneration (GTR). Two cases with similar clinical presentations are included. Case 1 was a 60-year-old healthy Caucasian female who presented with jaw expansion around teeth #'s 21 and 22. Initial exam revealed clinical gingival health on an intact periodontium. The patient presented with enlarged gingival tissue between teeth #'s 21 and 22 measuring 9 × 12 mm and vital teeth without root displacement radiographically. Case 2 had a similar clinical and radiographic presentation located between teeth #'s 5-6. Case 1 treatment included excisional biopsy with complete enucleation of the cystic lesion. Thereafter, GTR was performed using allograft internally then covered with a xenograft externally, resorbable collagen membrane (RCM), and primary closure. Case 2 was managed with excisional biopsy with lesion enucleation, GTR with allogenic bone graft, enamel matrix derivative and RCM, and primary closure. OKC enucleation combined with GTR using mineralized allograft, enamel matrix derivative, and collagen membrane or a layering technique of allograft internally and xenograft externally covered by a collagen membrane showed proper regeneration with stable periodontium at 6-36 months. Guided tissue regeneration is an acceptable treatment for management of OKC. Complete enucleation of an OKC lesion is important to reduce recurrence. The use of allograft with xenograft or allograft with enamel matrix derivative and RCM can provide proper bone fill after OKC removal. Odontogenic cysts are growths that can form in the jaw or soft tissues around the teeth. If not treated, they can grow larger, damage the bone, and even push teeth out of place. To prevent this, it's important to diagnose and remove them early. The most common way to treat these cysts is through a surgical method called enucleation, where the cyst is carefully removed. In these two cases, enucleation was used along with guided tissue regeneration, a technique to help the bone and tissue heal better after surgery. In the first case, a bone graft (made from human and animal bone) and a special material called a resorbable collagen membrane were used to protect and support the healing area. In the second case, a mineralized bone graft along with a substance that helps repair tissues called an enamel matrix derivative, and the same collagen membrane were used. Both patients healed well, and over the next 6 to 36 months, their bone and tissues around the teeth regenerated properly.","",""

Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the pooled mean for (1) baseline dehiscence defect dimensions, (2) changes in defect dimensions at re-entry, and (3) prevalence of complete defect resolution. 4298 unique records were identified, of which 21 studies with 680 implants were included. Despite having comparable baseline defect dimensions, greater height gains were achieved by implants with machined collars (MC) than noncollared (NC) implants (4.40 mm, 95% CI [3.70, 5.11] and 3.23 mm, 95% CI [2.72, 3.75] respectively), with significant subgroup differences (P < .01). Specifically, superior outcomes were observed for MC with space-maintaining geometries. However, there were no significant differences in the changes in defect width, prevalence of complete defect resolution, or the prevalence of postsurgical complication rates (P = .15, .54, and .18 respectively). The regenerative outcomes of GBR were influenced by the implant design. Space-maintaining machined collars provide a tenting effect that improves vertical bone gain.

Two reviewers conducted a comprehensive literature search across five databases: PubMed, PubMed Central, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. The review synthesized findings from 13 studies; in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies, highlighting that propolis significantly enhances antibacterial and antifungal activities against pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Streptococcus mutans, thereby reducing the risk of peri-implant infections. Additionally, propolis promotes osseointegration by stimulating osteoblast activity and reducing inflammatory cytokine expression, leading to improved bone formation and implant stability. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of propolis further contribute to a favorable healing environment, enhancing the long-term success of dental implants. The systematic review underscores the potential of propolis as a safe, biocompatible, and effective material for improving dental implant outcomes.

Standard cancer therapies often require the use of multiple agents, which can activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in tumor cells, leading to reduced cell death and increased drug resistance. Moreover, the use of multiple agents also contributes to added toxicity, resulting in poor treatment outcomes. Cancer cells gradually develop resistance to almost all chemotherapeutics through various mechanisms, such as drug efflux, alterations in drug metabolism and transport, changes in signal transduction pathways, enhanced DNA repair capacity, evasion of apoptosis, increased mutations, reactivation of drug targets, interaction with the cancer microenvironment, cancer cell-stroma interactions, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mediated chemoresistance, epigenetic modifications, metabolic alterations, and the effect of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Developing new strategies to improve chemotherapy sensitivity while minimizing side effects is essential for achieving better therapeutic outcomes and enhancing patients' quality of life. One promising approach involves combining conventional cancer treatments with propolis and its flavonoids. These natural compounds may enhance tumor response to treatment while reducing toxicity. Propolis and its components can sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, likely by inhibiting NF-κB activation, reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs; an M2-like phenotype), and thereby reducing the release of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, cytokines, chemokines, and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). By reducing TAMs, propolis and its components may also overcome EMT-mediated chemoresistance, disrupt the crosstalk between macrophages and CSCs, inhibit the maintenance of stemness, and reverse acquired immunosuppression, thus promoting an antitumor response mediated by cytotoxic T-cells. This review highlights the potential of flavonoids to modulate the responsiveness of cancer to conventional treatment modalities. The evidence suggests that novel therapeutic strategies incorporating flavonoids could be developed to improve treatment outcomes. The positive effects of combining propolis with chemotherapeutics include reduced cytotoxicity to peripheral blood leukocytes, liver, and kidney cells. Therefore, polyphenolic/flavonoid components may hold potential for use in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in the clinical treatment of various types of cancers.","",""

Partial or fully dentulous patients subjected to implant removal due to advanced peri-implantitis (≥ 50% of bone loss) lesions and seeking to have the failed implant replaced for esthetic or functional reasons were consecutively included. Guided bone regeneration was performed by means of a mixture of xenograft and autogenous bone and a ribose cross-linked barrier membrane. Re-entry for implant placement was performed at 4-month follow-up. Overall, six radiographic variables were assessed before (T0) and after (T1) alveolar bone reconstruction at four levels in ridge width (RW) and height (RH). Peri-implant conditions were evaluated at latest follow-up. Simple and multiple binary logistic regression models were calculated using generalized estimation equations to evaluate the effect of baseline upon reconstructive outcomes. In total, 20 patients (n implant = 39) met the inclusion criteria. Alveolar RW and RH were augmented from T0 to T1 at all levels. All implants achieved primary stability. Only ~13% were subjected to ancillary bone regeneration simultaneous to implant placement. After a mean follow-up period after loading of ~2.2 years, ~70% implants demonstrated peri-implant health, while mucositis was diagnosed in the remaining implants. The performance of alveolar bone reconstruction in residual partially contained defects simultaneous to implant removal due to peri-implantitis lesions demonstrates being safe and effective for implant site development.","",""

The shape, structural, mechanical, and biological manufacturing characteristics achieved through 3D printing technologies allow for the customization of implant-prosthetic rehabilitations and GBR procedures according to patient-specific needs, reducing complications and surgery time. Therefore, the present narrative review aims to elucidate the 3D-printing digital radiographic process, materials, indications, 3D printed manufacturing-controlled characteristics, histological findings, complications, patient-reported outcomes, and short- and long-term clinical considerations of customized 3D printed mesh, membranes, bone substitutes, and dental implants applied to GBR in oral implantology. Methods: An electronic search was performed through MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, BioMed Central, and Web of Science until 30 June 2024. Results: Three-dimensionally printed titanium meshes and bone substitutes registered successful outcomes in vertical/horizontal bone defect regeneration. Three-dimensionally printed polymeric membranes could link the advantages of conventional resorbable and non-resorbable membranes. Few data on customized 3D printed dental implants and abutments are available, but in vitro and animal studies have shown new promising designs that could improve their mechanical properties and tribocorrosion-associated complications. Conclusions: While 3D printing technology has demonstrated potential in GBR, additional human studies are needed to evaluate the short- and long-term follow-up of peri-implant bone levels and volumes following prosthetic functional loading.","",""

This technique involves placing a barrier membrane over the bone graft site, and the membrane prevents the invasion of soft tissue (such as gingival tissue) into the bone graft area. This allows the slower-growing bone cells to populate the area without competition, promoting proper bone regeneration. When combined, chitosan and gelatin create composite scaffolds that leverage the strengths of both materials. Chitosan provides structural integrity and antimicrobial properties, and gelatin enhances cell attachment and proliferation, which improves mechanical properties and makes it more suitable for supporting bone regeneration in load-bearing areas. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of chitosan and gelatin-based scaffolds in bone regeneration. Various databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, LILAC, and Google Scholar were screened to adhere to the eligibility criteria. The included studies in the review were the in vivo and in vitro assessment of the chitosan and gelatin efficiency as a scaffold. Six studies were investigated for the involvement of chitosan and gelatin-based scaffolds in bone regeneration. Of these, two in vivo studies examined bone regeneration by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) using different staining techniques, while the remaining four in vitro studies used histologic and histometric analysis where stem cells, chemicals, and other biopolymers were compared. Chitosan and gelatin scaffolds consistently showed better results in terms of bone repair throughout all six experiments. Gelatin's capacity for regeneration can be increased by mixing it with chitosan. For additional advancement, future researchers need to focus on incorporating biopolymers. The potential of scaffolds composed of gelatin and chitosan to replace tissue lost due to periodontitis shows great clinical significance.","",""

The patient's chief complaint was discomfort during mastication in the lower left molar region for a month. Clinical examination revealed that teeth 36 and 37 were intact without pain upon percussion, while tooth 38 was unerupted. The radiology examination illustrated a typical well-defined oval radiolucent lesion surrounding the crown of unerupted tooth 38, extending to the distal root of tooth 37. The treatment was divided into two parts: removal of the cyst and the impacted third molar, followed by filling with collagen bone particles; and preserving the tooth 37 via hemisection, root canal treatment and crown restoration. Pathological examination indicated a dentigerous cyst. After 18 months of treatment, the bone defect completely recovered and tooth 37 functioned well following the hemisection.

Cellular senescence is one of mechanisms involved in cell homeostasis and survival, and plays both important and detrimental roles in the maintenance of malfunctioned and normal cells. However, when exposed to various insults (genetic, metabolic and environmental), the cells undergo oxidative stress which may induce premature senescence, or so-called stress-induced premature senescence. Many age-related diseases are associated with premature senescence. Hence, there is growing interest in the intake of natural sources such as dietary food, which has protective functions on human health and diseases as well as on premature senescence. There are many natural food sources which have beneficial effects on delaying cell senescence, of which bee products are one of them. Bee products (honey, propolis, royal jelly, bee pollen, bee bread, venom and wax) are rich in polyphenols, a compound that exerts powerful antioxidant actions against oxidative stress and is able to delay premature senescence that is linked to ageing. This review describes the factors triggering senescence, the biomarkers involved and the prevention of senescence by the polyphenols present in bee products. Thus, it is hoped that this will provide new insights into the clinical management of age-related diseases.","",""

Understanding the specific configuration of defects and adjacent bone peaks is essential for tailoring treatment strategies and improving outcomes. The proposed Simple-Challenging-Difficult (SCD) difficulty classification was based on defect morphology (V-shaped, U-shaped, VV-shaped), including defect size (Height: < 5 mm, 5-8 mm, and > 8 mm), proximity of neighboring bony walls (Width: < 10 mm, 10-20 mm, and > 20 mm), as well as predictability of treatment outcomes. The proposed difficulty classification for VBA serves as a guide for selecting the most appropriate GBR treatment modality and sequence for safe and predictable management of VBA in implant therapy. In addition, when determining the preferred treatment, it is again essential to consider site-specific and patient-related factors alongside the clinician's surgical experience and skill. Identifying defect patterns and bone peak structures is crucial, and the proposed classification assists in decision-making in VBA treatment.","",""

Other therapeutic steps include auto-logous serum tears, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive eyedrops, or oral tablets. Management also targets Meibomian gland dysfunction and the ocular surface micro-biome. This article explores various therapeutic approaches, including natural compounds and complementary strategies. Natural compounds, such as vitamins, and herbal substances (e.g., trehalose), offer promising benefits in enhancing tear film stability and ocular surface protection. Apitherapeutic products like manuka honey and propolis exhibit antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, human tissue-derived solutions, such as auto-logous serum tears and amniotic membrane extracts, hold the potential for ocular surface regeneration. Other strategies, including polyherbal eye drops, liposomal eyelid sprays, and microbiome-supporting solutions offer alternative therapeutic avenues. Moreover, patient education, lifestyle modifications, and interdisciplinary collaboration play crucial roles in DED management, emphasizing the importance of holistic care approaches.","",""

The chemical composition of Propolis is determined based on the climatic and geographical conditions, as well as harvesting time and method. This compound has been the subject of numerous investigational endeavors due to its expansive therapeutic capacity which includes antibacterial, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-viral, and anti-cancer effects. The growing incidence rate of different cancers necessitates the need for developing novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and stem cell therapy have proved effective in cancer treatment, regardless of the adverse events associated with these modalities. Clinical application of natural compounds such as Propolis may confer promise as an adjuvant therapeutic intervention, particularly in certain subpopulations of patients that develop adverse events associated with anticancer regimens. The diverse biologically active compounds of propolis are believed to confer anti-cancer potential by modulation of critical signaling cascades such as caffeic acid phenethyl ester, Galangin, Artepillin C, Chrysin, Quercetin, Caffeic acid, Nymphaeols A and C, Frondoside A, Genistein, p-coumaric acid, and Propolin C. This review article aims to deliver a mechanistic account of anti-cancer effects of propolis and its components. Propolis can prevent angiogenesis by downregulating pathways involving Jun-N terminal kinase, ERK1/2, Akt and NF-ƘB, while counteracting metastatic progression of cancer by inhibiting Wtn2 and FAK, and MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Moreover, propolis or its main components show regulatory effects on cyclin D, CDK2/4/6, and their inhibitors. Additionally, propolis-induced up-regulation of p21 and p27 may result in cell cycle arrest at G2/M or G0/G1. The broad anti-apoptotic effects of propolis are mediated through upregulation of TRAIL, Bax, p53, and downregulation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Considering the growing body of evidence regarding different anti-cancers effects of propolis and its active components, this natural compound could be considered an effective adjuvant therapy aimed at reducing related side effects associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","",""

Beginning with the development of the mouth and anal pores on the second day of embryonic development, the digestive tract differentiates into the mouth and fore-, mid-, and hindgut during the pupal stage. The various glands within the oral cavity are particularly important, secreting enzymes and substances that are crucial for digestion and hive nutrition, e.g., invertase and royal jelly.

To date, commercial surgical meshes are typically made of non-absorbable synthetic polymers, notably polypropylene and polytetrafluoroethylene, which are associated with postoperative complications, such as infections. Biological meshes, based on native tissues, have been employed to overcome such complications, though mechanical strength has been a main disadvantage. The right balance in mechanical and biological performances has been achieved by the advent of bioresorbable meshes. Despite improvements, recurrence of clinical complications associated with surgical meshes raises significant concerns regarding the technical adequacy of current materials and designs, pointing to a crucial need for further development. To this end, current research focuses on the design of meshes capable of biomimicking native tissue and facilitating the healing process without post-operative complications. Researchers are actively investigating advanced bioresorbable materials, both synthetic polymers and natural biopolymers, while also exploring the performance of therapeutic agents, surface modification methods and advanced manufacturing technologies such as 4D printing. This review seeks to evaluate emerging biomaterials and technologies for enhancing the performance and clinical applicability of the next-generation surgical meshes. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In the ever-transforming landscape of regenerative medicine, the embracing of engineered bioabsorbable surgical meshes stands as a key milestone in addressing persistent challenges and complications associated with existing treatments. The urgency to move beyond conventional non-absorbable meshes, fraught with post-surgery complications, emphasises the necessity of using advanced biomaterials for engineered tissue regeneration. This review critically examines the growing field of absorbable surgical meshes, considering their potential to transform clinical practice. By strategically combining mechanical strength with bioresorbable characteristics, these innovative meshes hold the promise of mitigating complications and improving patient outcomes across diverse medical applications. As we navigate the complexities of modern medicine, this exploration of engineered absorbable meshes emerges as a promising approach, offering an overall perspective on biomaterials, technologies, and strategies adopted to redefine the future of surgical meshes.","",""

However, implanting GBR membranes inevitably triggers an immune response, which can lead to inflammation and failure of bone augmentation. It has been shown that GBR membranes may significantly improve in vivo outcomes as potent immunomodulators, rather than solely serving as traditional barriers. Macrophages play crucial roles in immune responses and participate in the entire process of bone injury repair. The significant diversity and high plasticity of macrophages complicate our understanding of the immunomodulatory mechanisms underlying GBR. This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent findings on the potential role of macrophages in GBR for bone defects in situ. Specifically, macrophages can promote osteogenesis or fibrous tissue formation in bone defects and degradation or fibrous encapsulation of membranes. Moreover, GBR membranes can influence the recruitment and polarization of macrophages. Therefore, immunomodulating GBR membranes are primarily developed by improving macrophage recruitment and aggregation as well as regulating macrophage polarization. However, certain challenges remain to be addressed in the future. For example, developing more rational and sophisticated sequential delivery systems for macrophage activation reagents; addressing the interference of bone graft materials and dental implants; and understanding the correlations among membrane degradation, macrophage responses, and bone regeneration.","",""

Propolis continues to gain considerable scientific interest due to its potential health benefits. The modern-day use of propolis in pharmaceutical preparations, such as toothpastes, mouthwashes, chewable tablets, mucoadhesive gels, and sprays, is increasing. However, the effectiveness of using propolis-containing pharmaceuticals in dentistry is not clear. The present paper aims to review the literature on the dental applications of propolis in preventive dentistry, periodontics, oral medicine, and restorative dentistry and discuss its clinical effectiveness. A literature search was conducted using Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. In total, 104 studies were included, of which 46 were laboratory studies, 5 animal studies, and 53 human clinical studies. Overall, the laboratory studies revealed a range of antimicrobial effects of propolis on oral pathogens. Clinical investigations of propolis in biofilm and dental caries control as well as adjuvant periodontal therapies reported positive outcomes in terms of plaque control, pathogenic microbial count reduction, and periodontal tissue inflammation control. Additional investigations included the use of propolis for the management of recurrent aphthous stomatitis, oral mucositis, and cavity disinfection after caries removal as well as the development of a range of restorative dental materials. Based on the reported outcomes of the studies, the clinical usage of propolis has potential. However, the majority of the evidence is derived from studies with flaws in their methodological design, making their results and conclusions questionable. As a consequence, properly designed and well-reported clinical studies are required to affirm the effectiveness of propolis for dental applications. Additionally, the safety of propolis and the optimal concentrations and extraction methods for its clinical use warrant further investigation. Utilisation of standardised propolis extracts will help in quality control of propolis-based products and lead to the achievement of reproducible outcomes in research studies.","",""

While it was originally thought that all bone grafts should be slowly resorbed and replaced with native bone over time, accumulating evidence has in fact suggested that the use of nonresorbable xenografts is favored for certain clinical indications. Thus, many clinicians take advantage of the nonresorbable properties/features of xenografts for various clinical indications, such as contour augmentation, sinus grafting, and guided bone regeneration, which are often combined with allografts (e.g., human freeze-dried bone allografts [FDBAs] and human demineralized freeze-dried bone allografts [DFDBAs]). Thus, many clinicians have advocated different 50/50 or 70/30 ratios of allograft/xenograft combination approaches for various grafting procedures. Interestingly, many clinicians believe that one of the main reasons for the nonresorbability or low substitution rates of xenografts has to do with their foreign animal origin. Recent research has indicated that the sintering technique and heating conducted during their processing changes the dissolution rate of hydroxyapatite, leading to a state in which osteoclasts are no longer able to resorb (dissolve) the sintered bone. While many clinicians often combine nonresorbable xenografts with the bone-inducing properties of allografts for a variety of bone augmentation procedures, clinicians are forced to use two separate products owing to their origins (the FDA/CE does not allow the mixture of allografts with xenografts within the same dish/bottle). This has led to significant progress in understanding the dissolution rates of xenografts at various sintering temperature changes, which has since led to the breakthrough development of nonresorbable bone allografts sintered at similar temperatures to nonresorbable xenografts. The advantage of the nonresorbable bone allograft is that they can now be combined with standard allografts to create a single mixture combining the advantages of both allografts and xenografts while allowing the purchase and use of a single product. This review article presents the concept with evidence derived from a 52-week monkey study that demonstrated little to no resorption along with in vitro data supporting this novel technology as a ""next-generation"" biomaterial with optimized bone grafting material properties.","",""

These techniques are based on a barrier membrane to direct the growth of new bone and gingival tissue at sites with insufficient volumes or dimensions of bone or gingiva for proper function, esthetics, or prosthetic restoration. Numerous studies have highlighted biocompatibility, space-creation, cell-blocking, bioactivity, and proper handling as essential characteristics of a membrane's performance. Given that bacterial infection is the primary cause of periodontitis, we strongly believe that addressing the antimicrobial properties of these membranes is of utmost importance. Indeed, the absence of effective inhibition of periodontal pathogens has been recognized as a primary factor contributing to the failure of GTR/GBR membranes. Therefore, we suggest considering antimicrobial properties as one of the key factors in the design of GTR/GBR membranes. Antibiotics are potent medications frequently administered systemically to combat microbes and mitigate bacterial infections. Nevertheless, the excessive use of antibiotics has resulted in a surge in bacterial resistance. To overcome this challenge, alternative antibacterial substances have been developed. In this review, we explore the utilization of alternative substances with antimicrobial properties for topical application in membranes. The use of antibacterial nanoparticles, phytochemical compounds, and antimicrobial peptides in this context was investigated. By carefully selecting and integrating antimicrobial agents into GTR/GBR membranes, we can significantly enhance their effectiveness in combating periodontitis. These antibacterial substances not only act as barriers against pathogenic bacteria but also promote the process of periodontal healing.","",""

The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database under the registration number CRD42022327123. Two review authors conducted a comprehensive and autonomous search for pertinent papers and extracted essential data.

Where possible, the GRADE Pro programme was used to assess the certainty of the evidence for all the outcomes. This review included 10 RCTs, comprising 825 participants aged between 18 and 69 years. Seven studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of propolis when applied topically, all of which used different formulations, concentrations, and carriers. The remaining three studies assessed systemic administration in tablet form. The duration of investigations ranged from 5 days to 3 years. The review team classified two studies as having an overall 'high risk' of bias, while the remaining studies were categorised as having an overall 'uncertain risk'. The overall certainty of the evidence was 'very low'. The results indicate that topical and systemic propolis may decrease the duration of healing, alleviate pain, and reduce redness in patients with RAS compared to a placebo. However, the certainty of the evidence is very low. These may be due to the high risk of bias, substantial heterogeneity, and limited sample sizes in the included studies. For these reasons, the results of this review should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, the limited number of adverse effects observed suggests that propolis may have a favourable safety profile when used for a short period in treating RAS.","",""

The aim of this systematic review was to obtain an updated analysis of the contribution of PCL-based scaffolds in the alveolar bone regeneration process. This review adheres to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for systematic reviews. A computerized search of the PubMed, EBSCO, Scielo and Web of Science databases was performed, restricting literature search to published studies in English or Spanish between January 2002 and March 2023. Database search returned 248 studies which were screened based on title, author names and publication dates. Data from 17 studies were reviewed and tabulated. All studies combined PCL with other biomaterials (such as Alginate, hydroxyapatite, bioactive glass, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)), growth factors (BMP-2, rhCEMP1), and/or mesenchymal stromal cells (adipose-derived, bone marrow, periodontal ligament or gingiva mesenchymal stromal cells). PCL scaffolds showed higher cell viability and osteoinductive potential when combined with bioactive agents.

This review presents state-of-the-art graphene-based dental surgery applications. Even if further studies and investigations are still needed, the GO coating could improve clinical results in the examined dental surgery fields. Better osseointegration, as well as increased antibacterial and cytocompatible qualities, can benefit GO-coated implant surgery. On bacterially contaminated implant abutment surfaces, the CO coating may provide the optimum prospects for soft tissue sealing to occur.

Two systematic reviews were prepared in advance of the Consensus Conference and were discussed among the participants of Group 1. Consensus statements, clinical recommendations, recommendations for future research, and reflections on patient perspectives were based on structured group discussions until consensus was reached among the entire group of experts. The statements were then presented and accepted following further discussion and modifications as required by the plenary. Dimensional changes of the alveolar ridge occurred after implant placement in healed sites, and a reduction in buccal bone wall thickness (BBW) of 0.3 to 1.8 mm was observed. In healed sites with a BBW of <1.5 mm after implant placement, increased vertical bone loss, and less favorable clinical and radiographic outcomes were demonstrated. Implants with buccal dehiscence defects undergoing simultaneous guided bone regeneration, showed less vertical bone loss, and more favorable clinical and radiographic outcomes, compared to non-augmented dehiscence defects during initial healing. At healthy single implant sites, probing depths, bleeding and plaque scores, and interproximal bone levels evaluated at 1 year, remained stable for up to 5 years, with or without STA. When single implant sites were augmented with connective tissue grafts, either for soft tissue phenotype modification or buccal soft tissue dehiscence, stable levels of the soft tissue margin, and stable or even increased soft tissue thickness and/or width of keratinized mucosa could be observed from 1 to 5 years. In contrast, non-augmented sites were more prone to show apical migration of the soft tissue margin in the long-term. Favorable aesthetic and patient-reported outcomes after STA were documented to be stable from 1 to 5 years. It is concluded that dimensional changes of the alveolar ridge occur after implant placement in healed sites and that sites with a thin BBW after implant placement are prone to exhibit less favorable clinical and radiographic outcomes.

Its main purpose is to prevent the migration of soft tissue into the osseous wound space, while allowing osseous cells to migrate to the site. GBR is classified into two main categories: resorbable and non-resorbable membranes. Resorbable membranes do not require a second surgery but tend to have a short resorption period. Conversely, non-resorbable membranes maintain their mechanical strength and prevent collapse. However, they require removal and are susceptible to membrane exposure. GBR is often used with bone substitute graft materials to fill the defect space and protect the bone graft. The membrane can also undergo various modifications, such as surface modification and biological factor loading, to improve barrier functions and bone regeneration. In addition, bone regeneration is largely related to osteoimmunology, a new field that focuses on the interactions between bone and the immune system. Understanding these interactions can help in developing new treatments for bone diseases and injuries. Overall, GBR has the potential to be a powerful tool in promoting bone regeneration. Further research in this area could lead to advancements in the field of bone healing.

Flavonoids have gained considerable attention among researchers, as they show a wide range of pharmacological activities, including coronary heart disease prevention, antioxidative, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, free-radical scavenging, anticancer, and anti-atherosclerotic activities. Plants synthesize flavonoid compounds in response to pathogen attacks, and these compounds exhibit potent antimicrobial (antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral) activity against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms. However, certain antibacterial flavonoids have the ability to selectively target the cell wall of bacteria and inhibit virulence factors, including biofilm formation. Moreover, some flavonoids are known to reverse antibiotic resistance and enhance the efficacy of existing antibiotic drugs. However, due to their poor solubility in water, flavonoids have limited oral bioavailability. They are quickly metabolized in the gastrointestinal region, which limits their ability to prevent and treat various disorders.

Therefore, to reduce the morbidities and complications associated with current treatment regimens, efforts have been made in translational research toward 3D-printed scaffolds to facilitate bone regeneration. Three-dimensional printed scaffolds should not only provide osteoconductive surfaces for cell attachment and subsequent bone formation but also provide physical support and containment of bone graft material during the regeneration process, enhancing bone ingrowth, while simultaneously, orthopaedic implants supply mechanical strength with rigid, stable external and/or internal fixation. In this perspective review, we focus on elaborating on the history of bone defect treatment methods and assessing current treatment approaches as well as recent developments, including existing evidence on the advantages and disadvantages of 3D-printed scaffolds for bone defect regeneration. Furthermore, it is evident that the regulatory framework and organization and financing of evidence-based clinical trials remains very complex, and new challenges for non-biodegradable and biodegradable 3D-printed scaffolds for bone regeneration are emerging that have not yet been sufficiently addressed, such as guideline development for specific surgical indications, clinically feasible design concepts for needed multicentre international preclinical and clinical trials, the current medico-legal status, and reimbursement. These challenges underscore the need for intensive exchange and open and honest debate among leaders in the field. This goal can be addressed in a well-planned and focused stakeholder workshop on the topic of patient-specific 3D-printed scaffolds for long bone defect regeneration, as proposed in this perspective review.","",""

Therefore, this analysis was designed to evaluate the long-term (≥12 months) clinical efficacy of GBR-supported reconstructive surgical therapy for peri-implantitis-related bone defects. In terms of resolving inflammation, the implementation of GBR protocols applying xenogenic bone substitutes yielded a higher reduction of bleeding on probing and probing depth value compared to the GBR protocol applying autogenous bone. Furthermore, for the changes in bleeding on probing and probing depths, GBR approaches using xenogenic bone showed superiority over the non-GBR treatments. Xenogenic bone with or without a barrier membrane was associated with improved radiographic bone levels and less soft tissue recession compared to the use of a GBR protocol implementing autogenous bone.

In addition, numerous growth factors (GFs) have been used as clinical applications in regenerative therapy. However, it has been established that the unregulated administration of these factors may not work to their full regenerative potential and could also trigger unfavorable side effects. The utilization of these factors in clinical settings is still restricted due to the lack of effective delivery systems and biomaterial carriers. Hence, considering the efficiency of bone regeneration, both spaces maintained using CMs and GFs can synergistically create successful outcomes in bone tissue engineering.

Deproteinized bovine bone mineral remains the best documented material for defect regeneration in peri-implantitis in combination with or without a barrier membrane. While studies using autogenous bone in peri-implantitis therapy are rarely found, they do report favorable potential of vertical bone regeneration. Moreover, while membranes are an inherent part of the guided bone regeneration, a 5-year follow-up study demonstrated clinical and radiographic improvements with and without a membrane. The administration of systemic antibiotics is frequently performed in clinical studies observing regenerative surgical peri-implantitis therapy, but the analysis of the literature does not support a positive effect of this medication. Most studies for regenerative peri-implantitis surgery recommend the removal of the prosthetic rehabilitation and the use a marginal incision with a full-thickness access flap elevation.

An alternative approach referring to the poncho technique may reduce the risk of dehiscence. The effectiveness of implant surface decontamination might have an impact on peri-implant bone regeneration without any clinical superiority of a certain technique. The available literature reveals that the success of peri-implantitis therapy is limited to the reduction of bleeding on probing, the improvement of the peri-implant probing depth and a small amount of vertical defect fill.

By placing barrier membrane on the root surface of the tooth to guide the adhesion and proliferation of periodontal ligament cells, periodontal tissue regeneration can be achieved. This review intends to analyze the current limitations of GTR membranes and to propose possible solutions for developing new ones. Limitations of current GTR membranes include nonabsorbable membranes and absorbable synthetic polymer membranes exhibit weak biocompatibility; when applying to a large defect wound, the natural collagen membrane with fast degradation rate have limited mechanical strength, and the barrier function may not be maintained well. Although the degradation time can be prolonged after cross-linking, it may cause foreign body reaction and affect tissue integration; The clinical operation of current barrier membranes is inconvenient. In addition, most of the barrier membranes lack bioactivity and will not actively promote periodontal tissue regeneration. Possible solutions include using electrospinning (ELS) techniques, nanofiber scaffolds, or developing functional gradient membranes to improve their biocompatibility; adding Mg, Zn, and/or other metal alloys, or using 3D printing technology to improve their mechanical strength; increasing the concentration of nanoparticles or using directional arrangement of membrane fibers to control the fiber diameter and porosity of the membrane, which can improve their barrier function; mixing natural and synthetic polymers as well as other biomaterials with different degradation rates in proportion to change the degradation rate and maintain barrier function; to improve the convenience of clinical operation, barrier membranes that meets personalized adhesion to the wound defect can be manufactured; developing local controlled release drug delivery systems to improve their bioactivity.

Due to the multifactorial nature of cancer, its pathophysiology is not completely understood so far, which makes it hard to treat. The current therapeutic strategies for cancer lack the efficacy due to the emergence of drug resistance and the toxic side effects associated with the treatment. Therefore, the search for more efficient and less toxic cancer treatment strategies is still at the forefront of current research. Propolis is a mixture of resinous compounds containing beeswax and partially digested exudates from plants leaves and buds. Its chemical composition varies widely depending on the bee species, geographic location, plant species, and weather conditions. Since ancient times, propolis has been used in many conditions and aliments for its healing properties. Propolis has well-known therapeutic actions including antioxidative, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. In recent years, extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that propolis possesses properties against several types of cancers. The present review highlights the recent progress made on the molecular targets and signaling pathways involved in the anticancer activities of propolis. Propolis exerts anticancer effects primarily by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis through regulating various signaling pathways and arresting the tumor cell cycle, inducing autophagy, epigenetic modulations, and further inhibiting the invasion and metastasis of tumors. Propolis targets numerous signaling pathways associated with cancer therapy, including pathways mediated by p53, β-catenin, ERK1/2, MAPK, and NF-κB. Possible synergistic actions of a combination therapy of propolis with existing chemotherapies are also discussed in this review. Overall, propolis, by acting on diverse mechanisms simultaneously, can be considered to be a promising, multi-targeting, multi-pathways anticancer agent for the treatment of various types of cancers.","",""

The ability of the material to evoke a foreign and inflammatory cell response in the pulpal tissue was not significant. The samples of both formocresol and growth factor group showed signs of pulpal necrosis which revealed the presence of a mild necrotic zone in one specimen at 3 months. One specimen from the propolis group showed mild areas of necrosis at the end of 6 months, where none of the specimens in the growth factor group showed areas of necrosis at the end of 6 months. The results of the present study showed a positive outcome for growth factor and propolis groups.

Due to the growing incidence of respiratory tract infections caused by various pathogenic viruses, complementary methods of prevention and therapy supporting pharmacotherapy are constantly being sought out. The properties of propolis may be important in the prevention and treatment of respiratory tract diseases caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza viruses, the parainfluenza virus and rhinoviruses. One of the main challenges in recent years has been severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing COVID-19. Recently, an increasing number of studies are focusing on the activity of various propolis preparations against SARS-CoV-2 as an adjuvant treatment for this infection. Propolis has shown a few key mechanisms of anti-SARS-CoV-2 action such as: the inhibition of the interaction of the S1 spike protein and ACE-2 protein; decreasing the replication of viruses by diminishing the synthesis of RNA transcripts in cells; decreasing the particles of coronaviruses. The anti-viral effect is observed not only with extracts but also with the single biologically active compounds found in propolis (e.g., apigenin, caffeic acid, chrysin, kaempferol, quercetin). Moreover, propolis is effective in the treatment of hyperglycemia, which increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The aim of the literature review was to summarize recent studies from the PubMed database evaluating the antiviral activity of propolis extracts in terms of prevention and the therapy of respiratory tract diseases (in vitro, in vivo, clinical trials). Based upon this review, it was found that in recent years studies have focused mainly on the assessment of the effectiveness of propolis and its chemical components against COVID-19.

The search yielded 538 results, discarding 459 studies that did not clearly meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 42 studies were included: 18 in vitro, one animal, and 23 randomized clinical trials. In vitro studies have demonstrated that propolis has antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens and clinical studies have reported its use as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal therapy. The clinical effects of propolis have been reported in conjunction with prophylaxis, polishing, and scaling and root planing (SRP). It has shown to have anti-plaque activity and improve gingival health. Propolis was found to be more effective in improving clinical parameters than conventional treatment (SRP alone) and demonstrated similar efficacy in treating chronic periodontitis compared to positive controls.

Placement of a cage in the intervertebral space has become a routine clinical treatment for spinal fusion surgery to provide sufficient biomechanical stability, which is required to achieve bony ingrowth of the implant. Routinely used cages for clinical application are made of titanium (Ti) or polyetheretherketone (PEEK). Ti has been used since the 1980s; however, its shortcomings, such as impaired radiographical opacity and higher elastic modulus compared to bone, have led to the development of PEEK cages, which are associated with reduced stress shielding as well as no radiographical artefacts. Since PEEK is bioinert, its osteointegration capacity is limited, which in turn enhances fibrotic tissue formation and peri-implant infections. To address shortcomings of both of these biomaterials, interdisciplinary teams have developed biodegradable cages. Rooted in promising preclinical large animal studies, a hollow cylindrical cage (Hydrosorb™) made of 70:30 poly-l-lactide-co-d, l-lactide acid (PLDLLA) was clinically studied. However, reduced bony integration and unfavourable long-term clinical outcomes prohibited its routine clinical application. More recently, scaffold-guided bone regeneration (SGBR) with application of highly porous biodegradable constructs is emerging. Advancements in additive manufacturing technology now allow the cage designs that match requirements, such as stiffness of surrounding tissues, while providing long-term biomechanical stability. A favourable clinical outcome has been observed in the treatment of various bone defects, particularly for 3D-printed composite scaffolds made of medical-grade polycaprolactone (mPCL) in combination with a ceramic filler material. Therefore, advanced cage design made of mPCL and ceramic may also carry initial high spinal forces up to the time of bony fusion and subsequently resorb without clinical side effects. Furthermore, surface modification of implants is an effective approach to simultaneously reduce microbial infection and improve tissue integration. We present a design concept for a scaffold surface which result in osteoconductive and antimicrobial properties that have the potential to achieve higher rates of fusion and less clinical complications. In this review, we explore the preclinical and clinical studies which used bioresorbable cages. Furthermore, we critically discuss the need for a cutting-edge research program that includes comprehensive preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies to enable successful translation from bench to bedside. We develop such a conceptual framework by examining the state-of-the-art literature and posing the questions that will guide this field in the coming years.","",""

A great number of papers have demonstrated that propolis from different parts of the world is composed mainly of phenolic substances, frequently flavonoids, derived from plant resins. Propolis has a relevant role in increasing the social immunity of bee hives. Experimental evidence indicates that propolis and its components have activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Mechanisms of action on bacteria, fungi, and viruses are known for several propolis components. Experiments have shown that propolis may act synergistically with antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirus drugs, permitting the administration of lower doses of drugs and higher antimicrobial effects. The current trend of growing resistance of microbial pathogens to the available drugs has encouraged the introduction of propolis in therapy against infectious diseases. Because propolis composition is widely variable, standardized propolis extracts have been produced. Successful clinical trials have included propolis extracts as medicine in dentistry and as an adjuvant in the treatment of patients against COVID-19. Present world health conditions encourage initiatives toward the spread of the niche of propolis, not only as traditional and alternative medicine but also as a relevant protagonist in anti-infectious therapy.

Because mechanisms that are meant to promote cellular longevity tend to decrease in effectiveness with age, it is no surprise that aging presents as a major risk factor for many diseases such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and diabetes. Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the intracellular antioxidant and overproduction of reactive oxygen species, is known to promote the aging process. Autophagy, a major pathway for protein turnover, is considered as one of the hallmarks of aging. Given the progressive physiologic degeneration and increased risk for disease that accompanies aging, many studies have attempted to discover new compounds that may aid in the reversal of the aging process.

The efficacy and compabitility of propolis depend upon factors, such as types of extracts and types of biomaterials. Generally, propolis appears to be compatible with hydroxyapatite/calcium phosphate-based biomaterials. Propolis enhances the antimicrobial properties of the resulting composite materials while improving the physicochemical properties. Furthermore, propolis is also compatible with wound/skin dressing biomaterials. Propolis improves the wound healing properties of the biomaterials with no negative effects on the physicochemical properties of the composite biomaterials. However, the effect of propolis on the glass-based biomaterials cannot be generalized. Depending on the concentration, types of extract, and geographical sources of the propolis, the effect on the glass biomaterials can either be an improvement or detrimental in terms of mechanical properties such as compressive strength and shear bond strength. In conclusion, two of the more consistent impacts of propolis across these different types of biomaterials are the enhancement of the antimicrobial and the immune-modulator/anti-inflammatory properties resulting from the combination of propolis and the biomaterials.","",""

However, little is known about the exact role of the biofilm in the etiopathogenesis of OM, as well as its influence in the permeation of a topical treatment. The objectives of this study were to review the literature for topical OM treatments in clinical trials, assess the efficiency of these treatments, and discuss factors that could affect the success of these treatments. First, a systematic search of articles published in the MEDLINE database (PubMed) between January 2010 and December 2019 was conducted, focusing on drugs under clinical trials for the topical treatment of OM. Of the publications selected, it was clear that none of them had considered the fungi organized in biofilm. Therefore, we reflected on some important variables involved in OM, such as the nail structure and the mechanism of fungal invasion. Some methods, such as histopathologic analysis and spectroscopy techniques, were found to be effective in the detection of nail biofilm, and could be used in future drug permeation studies. This review allowed us to conclude that novel antifungals for the topical treatment of OM must consider the drug to permeate through biofilm. Natural products, such as propolis, seem strong candidates in this respect.","",""

Therefore, it is important to promote the release of osteogenic/angiogenic growth factors. Since the discovery of heparin, its anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer functions have been extensively studied for over a century. Although the application of heparin is widely used in the orthopedic field, its auxiliary effect on bone regeneration is yet to be unveiled. Specifically, approximately one-third of the transforming growth factor (TGF) superfamily is bound to heparin and heparan sulfate, among which TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are the most common growth factors used. In addition, heparin can also improve the delivery and retention of BMP-2 in vivo promoting the healing of large bone defects at hyper physiological doses. In blood vessel formation, heparin still plays an integral part of fracture healing by cooperating with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Importantly, since heparin binds to growth factors and release components in nanomaterials, it can significantly facilitate the controlled release and retention of growth factors [such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), BMP, and PDGF] in vivo. Consequently, the knowledge of scaffolds or delivery systems composed of heparin and different biomaterials (including organic, inorganic, metal, and natural polymers) is vital for material-guided bone regeneration research. This study systematically reviews the structural properties and auxiliary functions of heparin, with an emphasis on bone regeneration and its application in biomaterials under physiological conditions.","",""

The present review was aimed at highlighting marker compounds for different types of propolis, produced by the species Apis mellifera, from different geographical origins and that display different biological activities, and to discuss strategies for quality control. Over 800 compounds have been reported in the different propolises such as temperate, tropical, birch, Mediterranean, and Pacific propolis; these mainly include alcohols, acids and their esters, benzofuranes, benzopyranes, chalcones, flavonoids and their esters, glycosides (flavonoid and diterpene), glycerol and its esters, lignans, phenylpropanoids, steroids, terpenes and terpenoids. Among these, flavonoids (> 140), terpenes and terpenoids (> 160) were major components. A broad range of biological activities, such as anti-oxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anticancer activities, have been ascribed to propolis constituents, as well as the potential of these compounds to be biomarkers. Several analytical techniques, including non-separation and separation methods have been described in the literature for the quality control assessment of propolis. Mass spectrometry coupled with separation methods, followed by chemometric analysis of the data, was found to be a valuable tool for the profiling and classification of propolis samples, including (bio)marker identification. Due to the rampant chemotypic variability, a multiple-marker assessment strategy considering geographical and biological activity marker(s) with chemometric analysis may be a promising approach for propolis quality assessment.

Worldwide, researchers are still studying the complex composition of propolis to unveil its biological potential, and especially its antimicrobial activity against a variety of multidrug-resistant microorganisms. This review explores scientific reports published during the last decade on the characterization of different types of propolis, and evaluates their antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Propolis can be divided into different types depending on their chemical composition and physical properties associated with geographic origin and plant sources. Flavonoids, phenols, diterpenes, and aliphatic compounds are the main chemicals that characterize the different types of propolis (Poplar, Brazilian, and Mediterranean), and are responsible for their antimicrobial activity. The extracts of most types of propolis showed greater antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria: particularly on S. aureus, as well as on C. albicans, as compared to Gram-negative pathogens. Propolis acts either by directly interacting with the microbial cells or by stimulating the immune system of the host cells. Some studies have suggested that structural damage to the microorganisms is a possible mechanism by which propolis exhibits its antimicrobial activity. However, the mechanism of action of propolis is still unclear, due to the synergistic interaction of the ingredients of propolis, and this natural substance has multi-target activity in the cell. The broad-spectrum biological potentials of propolis present it as an ideal candidate for the development of new, potent, and cost-effective antimicrobial agents.","",""

The therapeutic pleiotropy of bee products is due to their diverse composition and chemical properties, which is independent on the bee species. This has encouraged researchers to extensively study the therapeutic potentials of these products, especially honey. On the other hand, amid the unprecedented growth in nanotechnology research and applications, nanomaterials with various characteristics have been utilized to improve the therapeutic efficiency of these products. Towards keeping the bee products as natural and non-toxic therapeutics, the green synthesis of nanocarriers loaded with these products or their extracts has received a special attention. Alginate is a naturally produced biopolymer derived from brown algae, the desirable properties of which include biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-toxicity and non-immunogenicity. This review presents an overview of alginates, including their properties, nanoformulations, and pharmaceutical applications, placing a particular emphasis on their applications for the enhancement of the therapeutic effects of bee products. Despite the paucity of studies on fabrication of alginate-based nanomaterials loaded with bee products or their extracts, recent advances in the area of utilizing alginate-based nanomaterials and other types of materials to enhance the therapeutic potentials of bee products are summarized in this work. As the most widespread and well-studied bee products, honey and propolis have garnered a special interest; combining them with alginate-based nanomaterials has led to promising findings, especially for wound healing and skin tissue engineering. Furthermore, future directions are proposed and discussed to encourage researchers to develop alginate-based stingless bee product nanomedicines, and to help in selecting suitable methods for devising nanoformulations based on multi-criteria decision making models. Also, the commercialization prospects of nanocomposites based on alginates and bee products are discussed. In conclusion, preserving original characteristics of the bee products is a critical challenge in developing nano-carrier systems. Alginate-based nanomaterials are well suited for this task because they can be fabricated without the use of harsh conditions, such as shear force and freeze-drying, which are often used for other nano-carriers. Further, conjunction of alginates with natural polymers such as honey does not only combine the medicinal properties of alginates and honey, but it could also enhance the mechanical properties and cell adhesion capacity of alginates.","",""

From a pharmacodynamic perspective, propolis extract exhibited positive or synergistic interaction with several chemotherapeutic drugs by enhancing antitumor activity, sensitizing the chemoresistance cell lines, and attenuating multi-organ toxicity. The molecular mechanisms were associated with upregulating the apoptotic signal and immunomodulatory activity and attenuating oxidative damage. Propolis extract also enhanced the anti-bacterial and antifungal activities of many antimicrobial drugs against sensitive and resistant organisms, with an effect against the gram-positive bacteria stronger than that of the gram-negative bacteria. The synergistic action was related to strengthened action on interfering cell wall integrity and protein synthesis. The strong antioxidant activity of propolis also strengthened the therapeutic effect of metformin in attenuating hyperglycemia and pancreatic damage, as well as mitigating oxidative stress in the liver, kidney, and testis. In addition, propolis showed a potential capacity to enhance short-term and long-term memory function together with donepezil and improve motor function with levodopa and parasite killing activity with praziquantel. Pharmacokinetic studies showed inhibitory activities of propolis extracts on several CYP450 enzymes in vitro and in vivo.

Pieces of evidence show that supplementation with propolis may have therapeutic effects on RA patients. Due to increased inflammation and oxidative stress in the affected joints of RA patients, propolis could inhibit the inflammatory cascades by inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa B pathway and reducing reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and interleukin-17 by increasing some antioxidants. Therefore, inflammation and pain reduce, helping improve and control RA in patients. Further investigations are required with larger sample sizes and different doses of propolis to demonstrate the definite effects of propolis on various aspects of RA.","",""

The global demand for functional, eco-friendly, and efficient antimicrobial food packaging is increasing. However, the bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects of most conventional food packaging display limited action, and their major components are petrochemical materials (non-renewable, non-biodegradable, and not environmentally friendly), and the current target microorganisms easily acquire drug-resistant. Therefore, the development of more effective, sustainable and safe antimicrobial materials has become a research hotspot in food packaging. This paper systematically reviews the latest research on antimicrobial active packaging materials combining renewable and biodegradable polysaccharide-based substrates with green organic guanidine-based polymers, inorganic chlorine dioxide, or natural antimicrobial agents (such as essential oils, other plant extracts, chitosan, propolis, protein, bacteriocin, probiotics, and bacteriophages). The compositions, characteristics, antimicrobial mechanisms, and food applications of the various types of sustainable antimicrobial materials are updated, and future trends are explored. Although they show impressive properties, further studies are required to confirm the safety and efficacy of these materials as a majority of the studies have been conducted under laboratory conditions.

The different extraction procedures, key biologically active compounds, biological properties, and therapeutic potential of propolis were analyzed. It was concluded that propolis possesses a variety of biological properties because of a very complex chemical composition that mainly depends on the plant species visited by bees and species of bees. Numerous studies found versatile pharmacological activities of propolis: antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, etc. In this review, the composition and biological activities of propolis are presented from a point of view of the origin and standardization of propolis for the purpose of the development of new pharmaceutical products on its base. It was revealed that some types of propolis, especially European propolis, contain flavonoids and phenolic acids, which could be markers for the standardization and quality evaluation of propolis and its preparations. One more focus of this paper was the overview of microorganisms' sensitivity to propolis for further development of antimicrobial and antioxidant products for the treatment of various infectious diseases with an emphasis on the illnesses of the oral cavity. It was established that the antimicrobial activity of different types of propolis is quite significant, especially to Gram-negative bacteria and lipophilic viruses. The present study could be also of interest to the pharmaceutical industry as a review for the appropriate design of standardized propolis preparations such as mouthwashes, toothpastes, oral drops, sprays, creams, ointments, suppositories, tablets, and capsules, etc. Moreover, propolis could be regarded as a source for the isolation of biologically active substances. Furthermore, this review can facilitate partially overcoming the problem of the standardization of propolis preparations, which is a principal obstacle to the broader use of propolis in the pharmaceutical industry. Finally, this study could be of interest in the area of the food industry for the development of nutritionally well-balanced products.

Using biomimetic methods for artificial periosteum synthesis, membranous tissues with similar function and structure to native periosteum are produced that significantly improve the efficacy of bone grafting and scaffold engineering, and can serve as direct replacements for native periosteum. Many problems involving bone defects can be solved by preparation of idealized periosteum from materials with different properties using various techniques. This review summarizes the significance of periosteum for osteogenesis and chondrogenesis from the aspects of periosteum tissue structure, osteogenesis performance, clinical application, and development of periosteum tissue engineering. The advantages and disadvantages of different tissue engineering methods are also summarized. The fast-developing field of periosteum tissue engineering is aimed toward synthesis of bionic periosteum that can ensure or accelerate the repair of bone defects. Artificial periosteum materials can be similar to natural periosteum in both structure and function, and have good therapeutic potential. Induction of periosteum tissue regeneration and bone regeneration by biomimetic periosteum is the ideal process for bone repair.

Side effects of available medications (antihistamines and steroids), lack of patients' perceived effectiveness and high cost of biologic therapies (omalizumab) are challenges to the clinical management of allergic diseases. As allergy symptoms persist for a long time, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) such as propolis may be considered a potential prophylactic or therapeutic option to avoid long-term medication use. Propolis is a natural resinous substance produced by bees. Although propolis is well known to possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties, its anti-allergic potential is not fully explored. Several preclinical studies demonstrated the therapeutic effects of propolis extracts against allergic inflammation, asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy, which may be partly attributed to their inhibitory effects on the activation of mast cells and basophils. Clinically, the consumption of propolis as a supplement or an adjunct therapy is safe and attenuates various pathological conditions in asthma. Such an approach may be adopted for atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis. Although flavonoids (chrysin, kaempferol, galangin, and pinocembrin) and cinnamic acid derivatives (artepillin C and caffeic acid phenethyl ester) can contribute to the anti-allergic activities, they may not be present in all propolis samples due to variations in the chemical composition. Future studies should relate the anti-allergic activity of propolis with its chemical contents. This mini-review summarizes and discusses existing preclinical and clinical studies reporting the anti-allergic activities of propolis to provide insights into its potential applications in allergic diseases.","",""

The successful elimination of microbial infections remains a significant challenge, mostly because of the ever-growing development of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. The bacterial endurance in the root canal system contributes to features ranging from altered posttreatment healing to exacerbation of chronic periradicular immune response, which compromise the outcome of endodontic treatment. A highly effective strategy for combating infectious diseases and the associated inflammation-mediated tissue damage is to modulate the host immune response in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy. There are several medications currently used in endodontic treatment; however, they suffer various levels of microbial resistance and do not deliver all the required characteristics to simultaneously address both intracanal bacteria and periapical inflammation. The interaction of antimicrobial agents with the immune system can impact its function, leading to immune-suppressive or immune-stimulatory effects. The group of nonconventional antimicrobial medications, such as antimicrobial peptides, propolis, and nanomaterials, are agents that provide strong antimicrobial effectiveness and concomitant immunomodulatory and/or reparative effect without any host tissue damages. In this review, we provide an overview of local immune modulation in AP and a comprehensive review of the immunomodulatory effect of antimicrobial intracanal medications applied in endodontics with specific emphasis on the antimicrobial nanomaterial-based approaches that provide immunomodulatory potential for successful clinical deployment in endodontics.","",""

However, these techniques have limitations in the restoration of morphological and functional reconstruction, thus stopping disease progression but not regenerating lost tissue. Most promising candidates for regenerative therapy of maxillofacial bone defects represent postnatal stem cells, because of their replication potential in the undifferentiated state and their ability to differentiate as well. There is an increased need for using various orofacial sources of stem cells with comparable properties to mesenchymal stem cells because they are more easily available with minimally invasive procedures.

Types of Brazilian propolis are characteristic of geographical regions and respective biomes, such as savannas (Cerrado), mangroves, dry forest (Caatinga), rain forests (Amazon, Atlantic, and Interior forests), altitudinal fields (""Campos Rupestres""), Pantanal, and Araucaria forests. Despite the wide diversity of Brazilian biomes and flora, relatively few types of Brazilian propolis and corresponding resin plant sources have been reported. Factors accounting for the restricted number of known types of Brazilian propolis and plant sources are tentatively pointed out.

This paper is aimed at evaluation of the potential use of biodegradable polymer nonwovens releasing propolis as wound healing dressings, based on the literature data. Propolis is honeybee product with antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and regenerative properties. Controlled release of this substance throughout the healing should promote healing process, reduce the risk of wound infection, and improve aesthetic effect. The use of biodegradable aliphatic polyesters and polyester carbonates as a propolis carrier eliminates the problem of local drug administration and dressing changes. Well-known degradation processes and kinetics of the active substance release allows the selection of the material composition appropriate to the therapy. The electrospinning method allows the production of nonwovens that protect the wound against mechanical damage. Moreover, this processing technique enables adjusting product properties by modifying the production parameters. It can be concluded that biodegradable polymer dressings, releasing a propolis, may find potential application in the treatment of complicated wounds, as they may increase the effectiveness of treatment, as well as improve the patient's life quality.","",""

The gene has approximately 2000 known mutations and all of them affect in some degree the protein function, which makes the pathophysiological manifestations to be multisystemic, mainly affecting the respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and reproductive tracts. Currently, the treatment of the disease is restricted to controlling symptoms and, more recently, a group of drugs that act directly on the defective protein, known as CFTR modulators, was developed. However, their high cost and difficult access mean that their use is still very restricted. It is important to search for safe and low-cost alternative therapies for CF and, in this context, natural compounds and, mainly, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) appear as promising strategies to assist in the treatment of the disease. CAPE is a compound derived from propolis extracts that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, covering important aspects of the pathophysiology of CF, which points to the possible benefit of its use in the disease treatment. To date, no studies have effectively tested CAPE for CF and, therefore, we intend with this review to elucidate the role of inflammation and oxidative stress for tissue damage seen in CF, associating them with CAPE actions and its pharmacologically active derivatives.

Although chrysin's biological activities have been demonstrated and the mechanism of actions has been determined using in vitro and in vivo models, results from the current clinical studies were largely negative. A potential reason for chrysin's low efficacy in humans is poor oral bioavailability. In this paper, we reviewed the preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetics studies of chrysin and analyzed the mechanism of poor in vivo efficacy with emphasis on its bioavailability and ADME mechanism. Low aqueous solubility, rapid metabolism mediated by UGTs and SULT, efficient excretion through efflux transporters including BCRP and MRP2 are the major reasons causing poor systemic bioavailability for chrysin. However, because of efficient enterohepatic recycling facilitated by phase II metabolism and efflux, chrysin's bioavailability in the low GI tract is high. Thus, chrysin can be ideal for treating diseases in the terminal ileum and colon (e.g., carcinoma, local infection) since it is localized in the lower GI tract with limited delivery to other organs.","",""

Honey has found its healing application in various sectors of human life, as well as other bee products such as royal jelly, propolis, and bee pollen. There are many putative factors of CCD, such as air pollution, GMO, viruses, or predators (such as wasps and hornets). It is, however, believed that pesticides and microorganisms play a huge role in the mass extinction of bee colonies. Insecticides are chemicals that are dangerous to both humans and the environment. They can cause enormous damage to bees' nervous system and permanently weaken their immune system, making them vulnerable to other factors. Some of the insecticides that negatively affect bees are, for example, neonicotinoids, coumaphos, and chlorpyrifos. Microorganisms can cause various diseases in bees, weakening the health of the colony and often resulting in its extinction. Infection with microorganisms may result in the need to dispose of the entire hive to prevent the spread of pathogens to other hives.

This review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Two independent reviewers conducted an electronic search for articles published between 2008 and April 30, 2020, in four databases: (1) The National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE/PubMed) via Ovid; (2) Web of Science (WOS); (3) SCOPUS; and (4) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); also, a complementary handsearch was carried out. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used to assess the quality of evidence in the studies reviewed. Seven articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. A total of 1598 sinus lift surgeries were included, allowing the placement of 3604 implants. A total of 1115 implants were placed under previously perforated and repaired membranes, obtaining a survival rate of 97.68%, while 2495 implants were placed below sinus membranes that were not damaged during surgery, obtaining a survival rate of 98.88%. The rate of Schneiderian membrane perforation shown in the systematic review was 30.6%. In the articles reviewed, the most widely used technique for repairing perforated membranes was collagen membrane repair. Schneiderian membrane perforation during MFSA procedures with lateral approach is not a risk factor for dental implant survival (p=0.229; RR 0.977; 95% CI 0.941-1.015).

Among them, anti-tumor activity of CA has attracted much attention, and this potential has been confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. CA can induce apoptosis in cancer cells via enhancing ROS levels and impairing mitochondrial function. Molecular pathways such as PI3K/Akt and AMPK with role in cancer progression, are affected by CA and its derivatives in cancer therapy. CA is advantageous in reducing aggressive behavior of tumors via suppressing metastasis by inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition mechanism. Noteworthy, CA and CAPE can promote response of cancer cells to chemotherapy, and sensitize them to chemotherapy-mediated cell death. In order to improve capacity of CA and CAPE in cancer suppression, it has been co-administered with other anti-tumor compounds such as gallic acid and p-coumaric acid.

There are two distinct impacts with regards to antimicrobial and anti-parasitic properties of propolis, on the pathogens and on the host. With regards to the pathogens, propolis acts by disrupting the ability of the pathogens to invade the host cells by forming a physical barrier and inhibiting enzymes and proteins needed for invasion into the host cells. Propolis also inhibits the replication process of the pathogens. Moreover, propolis inhibits the metabolic processes of the pathogens by disrupting cellular organelles and components responsible for energy production. With regard to the host, propolis functions as an immunomodulator. It upregulates the innate immunity and modulates the inflammatory signaling pathways. Propolis also helps maintain the host's cellular antioxidant status. More importantly, a small number of human clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and the safety of propolis as an adjuvant therapy for pathogenic infections.","",""

In addition, membranes are expected to be bioactive to promote tissue regeneration. Objectives: This review aims to organize the fundamental characteristics of the barrier membranes that are available and studied for dentistry, based on their components. Results: The principal components of barrier membranes are divided into nonbiodegradable and biodegradable materials. Nonbiodegradable membranes are manufactured from synthetic polymers, metals or composites of these materials. The first reported barrier membrane was made from expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE). Titanium has also been applied for dental regenerative therapy and shows favorable barrier function. Biodegradable membranes are mainly made from natural and synthetic polymers. Collagens are popular materials that are processed for clinical use by cross-linking. Aliphatic polyesters and their copolymers have been relatively recently introduced into GTR and GBR treatments. In addition, to improve the tissue regenerative function and mechanical strength of biodegradable membranes, inorganic materials such as calcium phosphate and bioactive glass have been incorporated at the research stage. Conclusions: Currently, there are still insufficient guidelines for barrier membrane choice in GTR and GBR, therefore dentists are required to understand the characteristics of barrier membranes.","",""

The patients using only single medication as follows: insulin, metformin, or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs, were grouped according to their medication. These patients received implant placement with the same initial status, and all the prosthesis restorations were cement-retained ceramic crowns. The peri-implant marginal bone levels were evaluated by periapical radiographs immediately after implant placement and at 1 and 2-year follow-up visits. The baseline characteristics were compared among groups. The peri-implant radiographic marginal bone loss and clinical parameters were preliminarily compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and then the covariates were controlled by covariance analysis. Bonferroni post hoc adjustment test was performed for the multiple comparisons. After a review of more than 7000 medical records, a total of 150 patients with 308 implants at 1-year follow-up were assessed. The peri-implant marginal bone loss in the GLP-1 drug group was significantly smaller than the insulin group and metformin group (P < 0.01). The radiographic bone loss in the metformin group was higher than the insulin group (P < 0.05). Some of these included patients were lost to follow-up.

The major advantage of inclusion into CDs is increased aqueous solubility of such lipophilic substances. Accordingly, we present studies where the complexation of natural compounds such as propolis and dietary plant bioactives (e.g., tocotrienol, pentacyclic triterpenoids, curcumin) with γCD resulted in improved stability, bioavailability, and bioactivity in various laboratory model organisms and in humans.

Natural agents with immune-promoting potentials such as bee products are being explored as possible treatments. Bee honey and propolis are rich in bioactive compounds that express strong antimicrobial, bactericidal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant activities. This review examined the literature for the anti-COVID-19 effects of bee honey and propolis, with the aim of optimizing the use of these handy products as prophylactic or adjuvant treatments for people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Molecular simulations show that flavonoids in propolis and honey (e.g., rutin, naringin, caffeic acid phenyl ester, luteolin, and artepillin C) may inhibit viral spike fusion in host cells, viral-host interactions that trigger the cytokine storm, and viral replication. Similar to the potent antiviral drug remdesivir, rutin, propolis ethanolic extract, and propolis liposomes inhibited non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and these compounds along with naringin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells. Propolis extracts delivered by nanocarriers exhibit better antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 than ethanolic extracts. In line, hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving green Brazilian propolis or a combination of honey and Nigella sativa exhibited earlier viral clearance, symptom recovery, discharge from the hospital as well as less mortality than counterparts receiving standard care alone. Thus, the use of bee products as an adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 may produce beneficial effects. Implications for treatment outcomes and issues to be considered in future studies are discussed.","",""

Because Argentina has a wide plant biodiversity, it is expected that its propolis will have various botanical origins, and consequently, a different chemical composition. To date, five types have been defined. Based on their functionality, several products have been developed for use in human and veterinary medicine and in animal and human food. Because the Argentine propolis with the greatest potential is that of the Monte eco-region, this review will describe the findings of the last 20 years on this propolis, its botanical source (Zuccagnia punctata Cav.), its chemical composition, and a description of markers of chemical quality (chalcones) and functionality. Propolis can regulate the activity of various pro-inflammatory enzymes and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism enzymes, as well as remove reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.

Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) is used to handle this situation. The principle of GBR is to use a membrane to prevent the colonization of soft tissue cells of the bone defect and favors the migration of osteogenic linages. Current membranes do not completely fulfill the requirements that an optimal membrane should have, sometimes resulting in non-predictable results. Thus, the need to develop an ideal membrane to perform this duty is clear. Recent developments in bio-manufacturing are driving innovations in membranes technology permitting the active participation of the membrane in the healing and regenerative process trough native tissue mimicking, drug-delivery and cells interaction, away from being a passive barrier. New membranes features need specific evaluation techniques, beyond the International Standard for membrane materials (last reviewed in 2004), being this the rationale for the present review. Nanotechnology application has completely shifted the way of analyzing structural characterization. New progresses on osteoimmmunomodulation have also switched the understanding of cells-membranes interaction. To propose an updated protocol for GBR membranes evaluation, critical reading of the relevant published literature was carried out after a MEDLINE/PubMed database search. The main findings are that a potential active membrane should be assessed in its nanostructure, physicochemical and nanomechanical properties, bioactivity and antibacterial, osteoblasts proliferation, differentiation and mineralization. Immunomodulation testing for macrophages recruitment and M2 phenotype promotion in osteoblasts co-culture has to be achieved to completely analyze membranes/tissue interactions.","",""

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review paper on propolis to focus exclusively on its major effects for cardiovascular health. The propolis compound varieties with the most promising therapeutic benefits and their respective physiological mechanisms will be discussed. Propolis displays an anti-atherosclerotic activity, attained through modulation of the plasma lipid profile and through stabilization of the fatty plaque by inhibiting macrophage apoptosis, vascular smooth muscle proliferation and metalloproteinase activity. The antihypertensive effects of propolis probably arise through the combination of several mechanisms, including the suppression of catecholamine synthesis, stimulation of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and vascular anti-inflammatory activity. The anti-hemostatic activity of propolis is attributed to the inhibition of platelet plug formation and antifibrinolytic activity. By inhibiting the secretion of proangiogenic factors, propolis suppresses endothelial cell migration and tubulogenesis, exerting antiangiogenic activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are responsible for protection against vascular endothelial and cardiomyocyte dysfunction, mostly by the prevention of oxidative stress. Among the reviewed propolis varieties, the Brazilian green and red varieties show the largest number of beneficial activities. Further research, especially preclinical, should be conducted to assess the cardiovascular benefits of the given varieties with different compositions.","",""

Site-level analysis showed that the weighted mean incidence proportion of minor wound dehiscence and minor infections occurring at the augmented site was 9.9% [95% CI 6.4, 13.9, P < 0.01] and 1.5% [95% CI 0.4, 3.1, P = 0.21) respectively. Patient-level analysis showed minor and major complications occurring at a weighted mean incidence proportion of 16.1% [95% CI 11.9, 20.8, P = 0.01] and 1.6% [95% CI 0.0, 4.7, P < 0.01] respectively, while neurosensory alterations at the donor site was 7.0% [95% CI 1.3, 15.5, P < 0.01]. Subgroup analysis also revealed that the use of block grafts increased the incidence proportion of minor post-surgical complications, whereas a staged GBR procedure increased the incidence proportion of both minor and major post-surgical complications. Although exposure of the barrier membrane is often associated with less bone regeneration and graft resorption, the type of membrane used (resorbable or non-resorbable) had no statistically significant influence on any post-surgical complication. Histologically, a layer of fibrous connective tissue instead of bone is commonly observed at the interface between the native bone at the recipient site and the regenerated bone in cases with membrane exposure after GBR procedure. Minor wound dehiscence was the highest incidence proportion of post-surgical complications. Methods ranging from daily application of antiseptics, use of systemic antimicrobials, regular reviews, and total removal of the non-integrated biomaterials are commonly prescribed to manage these post-surgical complications in attempt to minimise the loss of tissue at the surgical site.","",""

PD threatens the quality of life of millions of patients and their families. Additionally, public welfare and healthcare systems are burdened with its high cost of care. Available treatments provide only a symptomatic relief and produce a trail of noxious side effects, which increase noncompliance.

Currently, this is the fourth highest cause of cancer mortality worldwide and its incidence is rising steeply. Commonly applied clinical therapies offer limited chance of a lasting cure and the five-year survival rate is one of the lowest of the commonly occurring cancers. This review cultivates the hypothesis that the best management of PDAC would be possible by integrating 'western' clinical medicine with evidence-based complementary measures. Protecting the liver, where PDAC frequently first spreads, is also given some consideration. Overall, the complementary measures are divided into three groups: dietary factors, nutraceutical agents and lifestyle. In turn, dietary factors are considered as general conditioners, multi-factorial foodstuffs and specific compounds. The general conditioners are alkalinity, low-glycemic index and low-cholesterol. The multi-factorial foodstuffs comprise red meat, fish, fruit/vegetables, dairy, honey and coffee. The available evidence for the beneficial effects of the specific dietary and nutraceutical agents was considered at four levels (in order of prominence): clinical trials, meta-analyses, in vivo tests and in vitro studies. Thus, 9 specific agents were identified (6 dietary and 3 nutraceutical) as acceptable for integration with gemcitabine chemotherapy, the first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer. The specific dietary agents were the following: Vitamins A, C, D and E, genistein and curcumin. As nutraceutical compounds, propolis, triptolide and cannabidiol were accepted. The 9 complementary agents were sub-grouped into two with reference to the main 'hallmarks of cancer'. Lifestyle factors covered obesity, diabetes, smoking, alcohol and exercise. An integrative treatment regimen was devised for the management of PDAC patients. This involved combining first-line gemcitabine chemotherapy with the two sub-groups of complementary agents alternately in weekly cycles. The review concludes that integrated management currently offers the best patient outcome. Opportunities to be investigated in the future include emerging modalities, precision medicine, the nerve input to tumors and, importantly, clinical trials.","",""

In particular, the mineralization of three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds has become a promising approach for guided bone regeneration.

The resulting scaffolds provide minerals chemically similar to the inorganic component of natural bone, carbonated apatite, Ca5(PO4,CO3)3(OH). In addition, we discuss the characterization techniques that are used to characterize the mineralized scaffolds, such as the degree of mineralization, surface characteristics, mechanical properties of the scaffolds, and the chemical composition of the deposited minerals. In vitro cell culture studies show that the mineralized scaffolds are highly osteoinductive. We also summarize, based on literature examples, the applications of 3D mineralized constructs, as well as the rationale behind their use.

This study examines exciting new hallmarks for the strict involvement of autophagy and TGF-β signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of diabetes and the design of novel therapeutic strategies. Dysregulated autophagy in pancreatic β cells due to hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation is associated with diabetes and accompanied by dysregulated autophagy in insulin target tissues and the progression of diabetic complications. Consequently, several therapeutic agents such as adiponectin, ezetimibe, GABA tea, geniposide, liraglutide, guava extract, and vitamin D were shown to inhibit diabetes and its complications through modulation of the autophagy pathway. Another pathway, TGF-β signaling pathway, appears to play a part in the progression of diabetes, insulin resistance, and autoimmunity in both type 1 and 2 diabetes and complications in diabetes. Subsequently, drugs that target TGF-β signaling, especially naturally derived ones such as resveratrol, puerarin, curcumin, hesperidin, and silymarin, as well as Propolis, Lycopus lucidus, and Momordica charantia extracts, may become promising alternatives to current drugs in diabetes treatment.

The lockdown measures and economic turndown associated with the current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are likely to increase the prevalence of sarcopenia by promoting sedentarism and unhealthy patterns of eating. Sarcopenia has multiple detrimental effects including falls, hospitalization, disability, and institutionalization. Although a few pharmacological agents (e.g., bimagrumab, sarconeos, and exercise mimetics) are being explored in different stages of trials, not a single drug has been approved for sarcopenia treatment. Hence, research has focused on testing the effect of nutraceuticals, such as bee products, as safe treatments to prevent and/or treat sarcopenia.

These products, in order, stimulate larval development into queen bees, promote defenses of the bee hive against microbial and environmental threats, and increase royal jelly production by nurse bees. Thanks to their versatile pharmacological activities (e.g., anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antimicrobial, etc.), these products have been used to treat multiple chronic conditions that predispose to muscle wasting such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorder, and cancer, to name a few. They were also used in some evolving studies to treat sarcopenia in laboratory animals and, to a limited degree, in humans.

Searches were performed in ISI, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases up to March 2020. According to the studies examined in this review, the administration of propolis can be useful in attenuating many aspects of clinical, macroscopic, and histological features of colitis in animal models. The efficacy of propolis in the treatment of IBD might be attributed to its potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory activities. Propolis may also be involved in the modulation of the gut microbiota and in the improvement of the intestinal mucosal barrier function. The major mechanism of action is most likely to be mediated via the prevention of some transcriptional factors and associated proteins. However, future studies are warranted to investigate the clinical utility of propolis as a candidate in the treatment of IBD.","",""

The traditional approach of oral implantation in individuals with both anxiety disorder and drug-induced osteoporosis poses a significant challenge. To address this issue, concentrated growth factor (CGF) has been utilized in patients undergoing concurrent alveolar ridge augmentation during oral implantation, resulting in favorable clinical outcomes. Consequently, combining CGF with guided bone regeneration (GBR) in alveolar bone increment may represent a promising new surgical approach for such patients. In this report, we present a case study of a 25-year-old male with anxiety disorder and drug-induced osteoporosis, in who CGF combined with GBR was employed in alveolar bone increment. This article reports the case of a 25-year-old male who underwent cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) due to the absence of his right lower second molar for a period of six months. The CBCT scan revealed significant bone defects, which were attributed to the tooth loss and prolonged use of anti-anxiety drugs. Consequently, the patient sought medical assistance from our department. Based on the patient's self-report, he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Additionally, the CBCT scan confirmed the loss of the right mandibular second molar and revealed the presence of dental irregularity and an alveolar bone defect. During the patient's course of treatment with anti-anxiety medication, a combination of CGF and GBR was employed for the simultaneous implantation of the missing right mandibular second molar, along with bone augmentation. The patient had a follow-up visit two weeks after the surgical procedure, and the wound in the operation area had healed satisfactorily. Six months later, CBCT images revealed excellent osseointegration. The buccal and lingual width of the alveolar bone measured 6.95mm, which was an increase of 1.35mm compared to the pre-implantation stage. This article presents a case study in which CGF combined with GBR were utilized to address alveolar bone augmentation during the implantation phase in patients taking anti-anxiety medication. The results demonstrated that CGF combined with GBR, as a cutting-edge platelet concentrate technique, could effectively stimulate bone tissue proliferation in individuals who have been on long-term anti-anxiety medication, specifically in oral implant areas. This approach can help prevent poor osseointegration, promote higher osseointegration rates, and facilitate wound healing.","",""

This case report presents a minimally invasive apical tunnel surgical technique, with propolis for root conditioning, to correct gingival recession defects without harvesting donor grafts, flap elevation, or sutures. Propolis is a natural anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant agent. A 58-year-old woman with no significant medical history was presented for root coverage of her upper left canine and first premolar with recession type (RT)1A (+). Propolis was used as a root conditioning agent to promote soft tissue coverage via an apical tunnel approach. During the apical tunnel approach, a small apical hole was made 6 mm below the mucogingival junction, and the mucosa and associated attached gingiva was away from the tooth so the flap could be repositioned coronally. Collagen matrix was used as a soft tissue graft material. At the 2-month, 6-month, 8-month, and 2-year follow-up, complete root coverage was achieved for both teeth. No bleeding on probing was noticed nor recurrent GRs at the treated sites. Without incisions, donor site reflection, or flaps, the apical tunnel approach can be successfully used to cover the exposed roots. Additionally, propolis is a potential root conditioning agent during soft tissue graft procedure due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.","",""

Innovative nanotechnological advances for skin anti-aging/rejuvenation are summarized and discussed in this work. The information in this review was extracted from recent and relevant studies using nanotechnology for anti-aging treatment from scientific databases. Results show an enhanced skin anti-aging effect of actives-loaded nanoparticles of next generation (nanostructured lipid carriers, fullerenes, transfersomes, protransfersomes, niosomes, ethosomes, transethosomes, glycerosomes, phytosomes) compared with nanocarriers of first generation or conventional formulations. Anti-aging active ingredients such as, flavonoids (rutin, hesperidin, quercetagetine, quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, myricetin, silibinin, curcuminoids, isoflavones); vitamins (E, D<sub>3</sub>, CoQ10); acids (hyaluronic, ascorbic, rosmarinic, gallic); extracts (Citrus sinensis, Tagetes erecta</i> L., Achillea millefolium</i> L., Citrus aurantium</i> L., Glycyrrhiza glabra</i> L., Aloe vera</i>, propolis earned by Apis mellifera</i>); and other compounds (adenosine, beta-glucan, heptapetide DEETGEF, resveratrol, cycloastragenol, melatonin, botulinum toxin, grapeseed oil), have been successfully entrapped into nanoparticles for skin rejuvenation. This encapsulation has improved their solubility, bioavailability, stability, permeability, and effectivity for skin anti-aging, providing a controlled drug release with minimized side effects. Recent studies show a trend of anti-aging herbal active ingredients-loaded nanoparticles, enhancing the moisturizing, antioxidant, regenerating and photoprotective activity of the skin. Suitable safety/shelf-life stability of these novel formulations is key to a successful translation to the clinic/industry.","",""

Clinical studies were eligible if they reported on pre-implant surgery in patients with oligodontia. The database search yielded 400 studies after duplicates removed. Thirty studies were finally included, involving 410 patients. Sixty-three sinus lifts were performed in 37 patients with no failure. Thirteen out of 33 patients with iliac bone transplantation and two out of 24 with parietal bone transplantation had resorption, one out of 4 patients who received allogeneic bone block had complete failure. Seventy-eight patients underwent guided bone regeneration, none had bone loss. No failure was found with the alveolar distraction osteogenesis technique. Four out of thirteen patients developed permanent hypoesthesia after inferior alveolar nerve transposition. The cumulative implant survival rate was 94.4% after bone augmentation procedures. Extensive edentulous areas should be grafted with parietal bone, as iliac grafts present a greater risk of resorption. Smaller edentulous areas should be treated by endobuccal harvesting or guided bone regeneration. Osteogenesis distraction and nerve transposition are effective surgeries for medium-to-large mandibular edentulous spaces. The implant survival rate is not significantly different between implants placed in grafted and nongrafted bone, the appropriate choice of bone augmentation technique can reduce the risk of peri‑implant bone resorption.","",""

In this review, we introduce how these pigments can contribute to the prevention of diabetes and obesity by stimulating glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion or inducing beige adipocyte formation. Of the anthocyanins, delphinidin 3-rutinoside (D3R) was shown to increase GLP-1 secretion. Pre-administered D3R-rich blackcurrant extract (BCE) significantly ameliorated glucose tolerance after intraperitoneal glucose injection in rats by stimulating the secretion of GLP-1 and subsequently inducing insulin secretion. D3R did not break down significantly in the gastrointestinal tract for at least 45-60 min after BCE administration. An increase in endogenous GLP-1 secretion induced by food-derived factors may help to reduce the dosages of diabetic medicines and prevent diabetes. Curcumin has various biological functions, including anti-obesity and anti-diabetic properties. However, high doses of curcumin have been administered in most animal and human trials to date, due mainly to the poor solubility of native curcumin in water and its low oral bioavailability. We demonstrated that a highly dispersible and bioavailable curcumin formulation (HC), but not native curcumin, induces the formation of beige adipocytes. Furthermore, co-administration of HC and artepillin C (a characteristic constituent of Brazilian propolis) at lower doses significantly induces beige adipocyte formation in mice, but administration of the same dose of HC or artepillin C alone does not. Our studies demonstrate that curcumin formulations or the co-administration of curcumin with other food-derived factors provide effects that native curcumin alone does not.","",""

While a systematic review of clinical studies evaluating rhPDGF in oral regenerative procedures has been recently completed, a review article that focuses on the histologic outcomes is needed. Hence, this communication discusses the histologic effects of rhPDGF-BB on oral and periodontal regenerative procedures, including root coverage and soft tissue augmentation, intrabony defects, furcation defects, peri-implant bone augmentation, and guided bone regeneration. Studies from 1989 to 2022 have been included in this review.","",""

The study was conducted according to the PRISMA statement and registered in PROSPERO. Risk of Bias (RoB) assessment and meta-analysis of clinical studies were performed (Review Manager 5, Cochrane). The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GradePro (GDT). Studies have shown propolis flavonoids inhibit viral replication in several DNA and RNA viruses, including coronaviruses. Propolis components have an aminopeptidase inhibitor activity that can inhibit the main proteases of SARS viruses and seem to inhibit protein spikes, which are sites of most mutations in SARS-CoV strains. The meta-analysis showed favorable results with the use of propolis on probing depth (95%CI: 0.92; p < 0.001), clinical attachment level (95%CI: 1.48; p < 0.001), gingival index (95%CI: 0.14; p = 0.03), plaque index (95%CI: 0.11; p = 0.23), and blending on probing (95%CI: 0.39; p < 0.001). The antibacterial activity of propolis could be mediated through its direct action on microorganisms or the stimulation of the immune system, activating natural defenses. Thus, propolis inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 as well as its bacterial activity. Treatment with propolis improves general health and facilitates the activation of the immune system against coronavirus.","",""

The presence of a residual BD is associated with a relevant incidence of peri-implant biological complications over time. Guided bone regeneration (GBR), performed at implant placement, is the most validated treatment to correct a BD. In the present systematic review, the evidence evaluating factors which could reduce the invasiveness of a GBR procedure with respect to patient-reported outcomes, intra- and post- surgical complications, was summarized. Factors included were: technical aspects, regenerative materials for GBR, and peri- and post-operative pharmacological regimens. The available evidence seems to indicate that the use of membrane fixation and flap passivation by means of a double flap incision technique may reduce the incidence of post-surgical complications. When feasible, the coronal advancement of the lingual flap is suggested. The use of a non-cross linked resorbable membrane positively impacts on patient discomfort. The adjunctive use of autogenous bone to a xenograft seems not to improve BD correction, but could increase patient discomfort. Systemic antibiotic administration after a GBR procedure does not seem to be justified in systemically healthy patients.","",""

Several key themes related to the anti-inflammatory properties of propolis were subsequently identified, namely in relation to cancers, oral health, metabolic syndrome, organ toxicity and inflammation, immune system, wound healing, and pathogenic infections. Based on the latest experimental evidence, propolis is demonstrated to possess various mechanisms of action in modulating inflammation towards the regulatory balance and anti-inflammatory environment. In general, we summarize that propolis acts as an anti-inflammatory substance by inhibiting and downregulating TLR4, MyD88, IRAK4, TRIF, NLRP inflammasomes, NF-κB, and their associated pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. Propolis also reduces the migration of immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, possibly by downregulating the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10.","",""

One study compared OAT to collagen membrane covered ACI (ACI-C). The 3 Level 1 systematic reviews/meta-analyses assessed the outcome of MFx, OAT, and various ACI methods in RCTs. OAT showed significantly better outcomes compared with MFx. In the 2 RCTs comparing ACI-P and MFx, no significant differences in clinical outcomes were seen, whereas significantly better outcomes were reported for M-ACI versus MFx in 1 study including patients with larger defects (5 cm2), and for ACI-C versus OAT in terms of Cincinnati Score. Higher failure rates were reported for MFx compared with OAT and for OAT compared with ACI-C, while no significant differences in failure rates were observed for ACI-P compared to MFx. Restorative cartilage procedures (ACI-C or M-ACI and OAT) are associated with better long-term clinical outcomes including lower complication and failure rates when compared with reparative techniques (MFx).

Therefore, in this systematic review, we evaluated the impact of propolis administration in diabetic animals. We used the PRISMA strategy to collect preclinical studies published in English up to November 2021 in three databases (PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science). We used the SYRCLE tool to analyze the risk of methodological bias. Our primary search returned 198 studies, of which 14 were considered eligible to be included in this review. The administration of propolis induced a hypoglycemic effect in the treated animals, which is probably due to the reduction of OS. The animals showed restoration of endogenous antioxidant defenses and reduced levels of markers for OS. The administration of propolis resulted in improvement in the lipid profile of treated animals. Our risk of bias assessment showed a methodological quality score of less than 30% due to a lack of randomization, blinding, and proper allocation of animals. Heterogeneity in treatments, lack of results, and use of non-standard extracts are limitations in our data analysis. Despite these limitations, propolis induced a significant hypoglycemic effect in diabetic animals when compared to untreated controls. This effect was associated with a reduction in OS, a process mediated by ROS neutralization and restoration of endogenous antioxidant defenses.","",""

This is particularly applicable in the severely atrophic posterior maxilla where sinus perforation (ruptured Schneiderian membrane) is a very common complication and sinus floor elevation or lift is frequently considered a standard procedure. The augmentation of the maxillary sinus can be performed with or without grafting biomaterials. Herein, numerous biomaterials and bone substitutes have been proposed, primarily to sustain the lifted space. In addition, cytokines and growth factors have been used to stimulate angiogenesis, enhance bone formation as well as improve healing and recovery period, either as the sole filling material or in combination with bone substitute materials. Within such, is the family of autologous blood extracts, so-called platelet concentrates, which are simply the ""product"" resulting from the simple centrifugation of collected whole blood samples of the patient, immediately pre-surgery. Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF), a sub-family of platelet concentrates, is a three-dimensional (3-D) autogenous biomaterial obtained, without including anti-coagulants, bovine thrombin, additives, or any gelifying agents during the centrifugation process. Today, it is safe to say that, in implant dentistry and oral and maxillofacial surgery, PRFs (particularly, the pure platelet-rich fibrin or P-PRF and leukocyte and platelet-rich fibrin or L-PRF sub-classes) are receiving the most attention, essentially due to their simplicity, rapidness, user-friendliness/malleability, and cost-effectiveness. Whether used as the sole ""bioactive"" filling/additive material or combined with bone substitutes, the revolutionary second-generation PRFs have been very often associated with promising clinical results. Hence, this review aims to provide a 10-years update on the clinical effectiveness of L-PRF when applied/used as the ""sole"" biomaterial in maxillary sinus augmentation procedures. An electronic search using specific keywords for L-PRF and maxillary sinus augmentation was conducted in three main databases (PubMed-MEDLINE database, Google Scholar and Cochrane library) for the period between January 2009-February 2020. The quest yielded a total of 468 articles. Based on the pre-established strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, only seven articles were deemed eligible and included in the analysis. Surprisingly, of the 5 studies which used de-proteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) in combination with L-PRF, 60% acclaimed no significant effects and only 40% declared positive effects. Of the two articles which had used allogenous bone graft, 50% declared no significant effects and 50% acclaimed positive effects. Only one study had used L-PRF as the sole grafting material and reported a positive effect. Likewise, positive effects were reported in one other study using L-PRF in combination with a collagen membrane. Due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, this review is limited by the inability to perform a proper systematic meta-analysis. Overall, most of the published studies reported impressive results of L-PRF application as a grafting material (sole or adjuvant) in maxillary sinus augmentation and dental implant restorative procedures. Yet, distinct technical processing for L-PRF preparation was noted. Hence, studies should be approached with caution. Here in, in sinus lift and treatment of Schneider membrane, the formation of mature bone remains inconclusive. More studies are eagerly awaited in order to prove the beneficial or detrimental effects of PRFs, in general and L-PRFs, in specific; especially in their tissue regenerative potential pertaining to the promotion of angiogenesis, enhancing of cell proliferation, stimulation of cell migration and autocrine/paracrine secretion of growth factors, as well as to reach a consensus or a conclusive and distinct determination of the effect of leukocytes (and their inclusion) on inflammation or edema and pain; a call for standardization in PRFs and L-PRFs composition reporting and regimenting the preparation protocols.","",""
