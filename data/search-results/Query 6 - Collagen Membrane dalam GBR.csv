A 47-year-old male with an atrophic posterior maxilla (residual bone height (RBH): 1.0 mm) presented with a dome-shaped MRC measuring 22.13 × 15.86 × 27.94 mm (3,266.83 mm³). A lateral window SFE was performed with cyst drainage, careful elevation of the Schneiderian membrane, and grafting using particulate xenograft, covered by a collagen membrane. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was obtained at one month (T1), eight months (T2), and six years (T3) to assess graft volume and density. At eight months, a guided Ø4.3 × 8.5 mm implant was placed, and a trephine core biopsy was collected for histologic and histomorphometric evaluation. Postoperative healing was uneventful, and the patient remained asymptomatic throughout follow-up. At T1, graft volume was 1,978.61 mm³ (297.24 HU), and the cyst regressed by 6.10% compared with baseline. At T2, graft volume decreased to 1,737.67 mm³ (-12.18% vs. T1), with increased density (690.74 HU), and the MRC was radiographically resolved. Histomorphometric analysis revealed 25.76% new bone, 47.20% residual graft, and 27.04% connective tissue. At T3, graft volume remained 1,508.57 mm³ (-23.76% vs. T1), with a density of 785.91 HU, indicating long-term bone maturation and consolidation. The maxillary sinus remained functional and asymptomatic, with stable peri-implant tissues and no recurrence of the MRC. Simultaneous management of an MRC during lateral SFE allowed safe cyst drainage, predictable graft consolidation, histologic confirmation of new bone formation, and long-term implant success. This single-stage approach represents a pragmatic and effective treatment option in carefully selected cases of atrophic maxilla with cystic sinus lesions.","",""

A 2 mm high cap screw was connected to the implant with the aim of not letting a cross-linked collagen membrane to collapse over the implant threads. This membrane covered the implant and the whole defect, filled with a porcine bone graft wet with hyaluronic acid. A second membrane, made of dense polytetrafluoroethylene (dPTFE), was placed over the previous one and left exposed, avoiding a second intervention for its removal, which occurred after a 5-week healing time by grasping the membrane with forceps and removing it with a gentle tug. After cap screw removal, it was possible to insert an healing abutment. The augmented bone remained stable 2.5 years after prosthetic superstructure re-insertion. Soft tissue architecture was maintained since the flaps were not repositioned coronally, the mucogingival line and the fornix were not distorted, and there was no reduction of keratinized mucosa. The benefits of this technique include the reliable defect isolation and containment of graft particles, ease of membrane placement, simplified dPTFE membrane removal, and preservation of mucogingival architecture. The prosthetic superstructure removal provides better access to the surgical site in order to perform the defect debridement and the implant surface decontamination and detoxification, before placing the reconstructive biomaterials. The use of a 2 mm high closure cap or a short healing abutment prevents membrane collapse on the implant threads. Since the dense polytetrafluoroethylene membrane is not buried, but intentionally left exposed, its removal after a 5-6-week healing period doesn't require a second surgery. Furthermore, it is also possible to re-insert the prosthetic superstructure, reducing the overall treatment time generally respected with the conventional submerged approach, which involves uncovering the implant after a healing period of 6-9 months. The authors describe a new technique for the reconstruction of intra-bony vertical defects caused by peri-implantitis, which requires the removal of the prosthetic superstructure to have better access to the surgical site, in order to perform the defect debridement and the implant surface decontamination and detoxification, before placing the reconstructive biomaterials. Two membranes are used: a collagen membrane that covers the whole defect filled with a xenograft, and a dense polytetrafluoroethylene membrane, applied over the collagen one, that is intentionally left exposed in order to easily remove it after a 5-6-week healing period without a second surgery. This cost-effective, predictable treatment protocol is indicated for the general practitioner who usually doesn't treat complex cases requiring advanced skills.","",""

Implant rehabilitation is the gold standard treatment; however, prior bone reconstructions may be necessary. The Barbell Technique is a guided bone regeneration technique recommended for defects of various morphologies, allowing for vertical and horizontal unidirectional or bidirectional regeneration, that is, both on the buccal and palatal/lingual sides. The objective of this paper is to report a case of bone reconstruction in the posterior maxilla prior to implant rehabilitation, where the Barbell Technique was performed together with a sinus lift. Methods: This study consists of a case report of a 77-year-old male patient with the absence of first and second right bicuspids and a history of implant losses in the area. The initial CT scan showed horizontal and vertical alveolar atrophy, making implant placement impossible. Regeneration was performed using a sinus lift for vertical recovery and the Barbell Technique for horizontal regeneration, using xenogeneic bone covered by a collagen membrane. After 6 months, a new CT scan suggested sufficient bone volume, and two implants were guidedly placed based on digital planning. Results: Comparison of CT scans before and after the grafts showed a horizontal bone gain of 70% and a vertical gain of 33%. Six months after the reconstructive surgery, dental implants were placed, followed by the installation of individual crowns after 45 days. At the 24-month follow-up, no complications related to the implants or prostheses were observed. Conclusion: In this clinical case, for the first time in the literature, the association of the techniques allowed the regeneration of the defect, with the subsequent placement of implants in the ideal position and prosthetic rehabilitation.","",""

Seven months later, a provisional restoration was delivered, followed by the placement of a definitive screw-retained crown 120 days afterward. No complications were reported throughout the treatment, and the patient consistently maintained excellent oral hygiene. This case underscores the feasibility of implant therapy in immunocompromised patients, despite longstanding concerns regarding the potential negative impact of immunosuppressive agents on bone metabolism and healing. Treatment success relied on a thorough medical history review, precise planning, minimally invasive surgical techniques, and the use of specific postoperative medications. Regular follow-up visits and diligent oral hygiene were also key to the favorable outcome. While this individual case was successful, further clinical studies are needed to establish comprehensive guidelines for implant treatment in patients with autoimmune conditions or organ transplants who are receiving immunosuppressive and systemic anti-inflammatory therapy.","",""

The scaffold we used is a nonparticulate osteoconductive bone substitute for repairing defects without migration of particles and maintaining volume above the walls and confines of the periodontal treatment site. This may provide a more predictable option for rebuilding lost supporting bone, especially in less contained defects. A case of periodontitis stage III grade A at tooth no. 5 treated with intentional defect overfill to sustain interdental papilla with filling of the defect. Established guided tissue regeneration techniques were used. After 15 days, complete soft tissue closure at the defect site and root coverage at tooth 6 due to coronal advancement of the flap were observed. After 1 year, the papilla between teeth 6 and 5 filled the interproximal space, recession at 6 and 5 was 0 mm, and clinical attachment level gain at 5 was 4 mm. Soft-tissue maturation continued over 2 years, showing increasing thickness and healthy aspect. Over 24 months, increasingly defined bone-like imagery of the infrabony defect was obtained on X-ray without probing. Using a cross-linked, completely resorbable collagen scaffold covered with a membrane based on the same engineering promoted tissue growth above the walls of the defect. This was effective in bone regeneration of an intrabony defect. Why is this case new information? This is a case report describing the use of a completely resorbable ossifying collagen sponge with intentional overfill of the periodontal defect. This surgical technique allowed the clinician to improve the reduced interdental papilla architecture together with filling of the defect. This outcome represents a difficult and unpredictable goal for traditional periodontal reconstructive therapy. What are the keys to successful management of this case? Proper diagnosis and treatment planning Adequate and minimally invasive nonsurgical preoperative preparation of the soft tissues Graft trimming and proper adaptation Soft tissue management with mucogingival approach (split thickness papilla incision-flap elevation-sutures) What are the primary limitations to success in this case? Inadequate preoperative nonsurgical therapy Poor handling of soft tissue Inadequate graft shaping Strict adherence to pre- and postoperative oral hygiene and maintenance PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Bone or bone substitutes can be used to rebuild lost supporting bone in dental repairs. A female patient at risk of tooth loss because of gum infection and with a gap between two of her teeth was surgically treated with an ossifying collagen sponge (OSSIX Bone, Dentsply Sirona/Regenerative Solutions, Charlotte, NC, USA), covered by an ossifying collagen membrane (OSSIX Plus, Dentsply Sirona/Regenerative Solutions, Charlotte, NC, USA). This ossifying collagen sponge can be shaped as needed. This allowed the clinician to intentionally overfill during the procedure to treat the patient. Surgery was successful, with the patient's condition and defects repaired. She did not experience infection, pain, swelling, or discomfort as a result of the treatment. This is a novel use of this ossifying collagen sponge substitute. More studies may confirm the suitability of the bone substitute used in this case more generally in similar dental repair procedures.","",""

Until now, the only predictable way was the use of titanium-reinforced dense polytetrafluoroethylene (TR-dPTFE) membranes stabilized with self-drilling screws, which require large flaps for both placement and removal. This case report introduces a technique that does not require any membrane lingual fixation. A tenting screw was placed in the middle of an anterior mandibular defect. A small TR-dPTFE membrane was bent 90° to take an L shape and be positioned crestally and lingually to the defect. Then, a larger collagen membrane (CM) was sutured with absorbable stitches to its more lingual and apical part. The TR-dPTFE membrane was stabilized on top of the tenting screw with its cap screw. A mixture of autogenous and porcine bone in a 1:1 ratio filled the defect. Then, the CM was moved toward the buccal side and stabilized with pins. After 8 months, the site was re-opened, the TR-dPTFE membrane and the tenting screw were removed with a small lingual envelope flap, two implants were inserted in the augmented bone and healing abutments applied. A screw-retained bridge was delivered 6 weeks after implant insertion and the 2.5-year follow-up showed perfectly maintained hard and soft tissues. The stabilization of both membranes to the tenting screw reduced morbidity at re-entry avoiding a large lingual flap, while CM allowed graft revascularization from the periosteum, and resulted in optimal quality of the regenerated bone. Titanium-reinforced dense polytetrafluoroethylene (TR-dPTFE) membranes require stabilization with pins or screws at the recipient site and large flaps for both placement and removal. On the lingual side of the anterior mandible the use of miniscrews is difficult and invasive, while the use of a tenting screw, placed vertically in the middle of the defect, allows for a simple and easy membrane stabilization and removal. Two membranes are utilized: a small TR-dPTFE membrane, that is stabilized to the tenting screw with its cap screw, and that does not allow to a collagen membrane (CM), that is sutured to the TR-PTFE membrane to cover the exposed part of the defect, to collapse over the bone deficiency. The CM, that covers the majority of the defect, after its biodegradation, allows graft revascularization from the periosteum, and results in optimal quality of the regenerated bone. Vertical bone defects of the jaws require bone augmentation procedures to allow the correct implants insertion to rehabilitate the masticatory function and aesthetics of patients. Among these techniques, guided bone regeneration is one of the most widely used. This technique is based on the use of non-absorbable titanium-reinforced dense polytetrafluoroethylene (TR-dPTFE) barrier membranes whose titanium frame allows them to be given a shape and not collapse onto the underlying bone defect. Since these membranes require screw stabilization to the recipient bone, large flaps must be performed to place and remove them. A technique is proposed that simplifies the positioning of the TR-dPTFE membrane, with the application of a tenting screw positioned in the center of the bone defect to which the membrane is stabilized. This procedure eliminates the need to place screws on the lingual side and the execution of a large lingual flap for its removal at the time of surgical re-entry. Furthermore, a re-absorbable collagen membrane is sutured to the TR-dPTFE membrane, the extension of which is limited to the crestal and lingual part, to cover the buccal part and the entire defect, improving the maturation of the bone graft inserted below the two membranes.","",""

SFOT was performed on the mandible using particulate allograft combined with platelet rich fibrin (PRF) and collagen membrane to augment soft and hard tissue, thereby preventing future recessions, while accelerating the treatment times. Six-month and 3-year follow-ups confirmed radiographic bone fill, absence of gingival recession and thick band of keratinized gingiva. SFOT also resulted in a shorter treatment time where desired tooth movements were achieved within 6 months with periodontal stability. SFOT provided clinical benefits by accelerating orthodontic movement, improving periodontal phenotype, preventing the displacement of teeth beyond the alveolar housing and minimizing the risk for development of dehiscences and gingival recessions. Orthodontic movements can create recessions and dehiscence in thin periodontal phenotypes. SFOT can help prevent bone dehiscence and creates a thicker gingival phenotype while accelerating treatment time. Adults who face lengthy orthodontic treatments and have thin gums have risks of gum problems. Surgically facilitated orthodontic treatment (SFOT) can help by speeding up tooth movements and improving gum health and thickness. A patient with thin gums and lack of bone in the lower front teeth was evaluated. The SFOT procedure involved using a bone graft, healing factors, and a collagen membrane to strengthen the gums and bones. This approach aimed to prevent future gum problems and speed up orthodontic treatment. Follow-ups at 6 months and 3 years after treatment showed good healing of the gums and bones, with no signs of gum recession and healthier, thicker gums. The desired tooth movements were achieved within 6 months, resulting in a shorter treatment time. The patient's gums remained stable throughout this period.

In these cases, treatments to control sinus infection were performed using an otolaryngologist; then, intraoral interventions comprising mucosal flap procedures, bone grafts, and barrier membrane applications were performed 2-5 times by oral surgeons. Nevertheless, OAF recurred persistently. The failure to stop OAF recurrence may be due to the inability to effectively block air pressure at the OAF site. Following a comprehensive debridement of the infected tissue at the previous sinus augmentation site, a pouch was created through sinus mucosal elevation. The perforated sinus mucosa at the OAF site was covered with a non-resorbable membrane in one case and with resorbable collagen membranes in the other two cases, followed by bone grafting within the pouch.

However, the long-term efficacy of such treatments remains unclear. This clinical report presents a case of peri-implantitis management in a healthy 55-year-old male using guided bone regeneration principles and surface decontamination via aPDT. The patient exhibited peri-implantitis with probing pocket depths (PPD) of 7 mm at buccal sites, 5 mm at palatal sites, and significant bone loss around implant #12.

Guided bone regeneration (GBR) was performed using the TTSB technique, involving the preparation of a collagen membrane that is perforated, folded, and sutured to form a bag that is then filled with a xenogeneic bone graft material. The bag is then inserted into a subperiosteal tunnel. Horizontal bone gain (HBG) was calculated 6 months after the surgery using CBCT. Healing was uneventful and with minimal morbidity. Average HBG was 3.7 ± 1.8 mm (P < .05), with a vertical component gain of 1.3 ± 1.7 mm (P > .05). In 12 patients, additional bone augmentation was required at the time of implant placement. A higher HBG was achieved in the maxilla than in the mandible (4.3 ± 1.3 mm vs 3.2 ± 1.8 mm, respectively; P < .05), and sites with an initial horizontal ridge width ≤ 3.5 mm were associated with a higher chance of requiring additional bone grafting at the time of implant placement compared to sites with an initial horizontal ridge width > 3.5 mm.

The defect was filled with a mix of particulate autogenous bone and porcine xenograft in a 1:1 ratio. A collagen membrane covered the hole pattern of the TR-dPTFEM to prevent soft tissue growth within the grafted material during the first weeks.

Likewise, the scores for the modified plaque index (mPI) and modified sulcular bleeding index (mBI) were reduced by 0.5 (-0.5-1.1) and 1.6 (0.4-2.4), respectively. SUP did not display at any implant site at T2 (59.2% implants in 29.2% patients suppurated at T0). Keratinized mucosa decreased 0.6 mm (-0.2-4.4) and while mucosal recession increased 2.5 mm (1.0-4.3). Alike, the radiographic parameters varied significantly from T0 through T2. Infrabony defects were filled by 2.2 mm (0.0-8.6) at T2 and marginal bone loss was reduced by 2.3 mm (-1.1-8.1). The mean VAS score significantly increased from T0 (56.7) through T1 to T2, reaching a score of 96 at T2. At this timepoint, 85.2% of the peri-implantitis lesions were resolved. The proposed surgical approach followed by submerged healing to reconstruct peri-implant bone defects may offer one therapeutic option for failing dental implants. Given the nature of the present study, its effectiveness in comparison to less invasive treatments needs investigation in randomized controlled trials.","",""

Since the regenerative treatment can often be unpredictable and have esthetic consequences such as soft tissue recession due to flap raising, extraction is sometimes recommended. In order to place a new implant after extraction, a bone regeneration procedure must be carried out. This implies raising a flap and therefore the risk of further interproximal gingival recession. In the case presented in this article, a hopeless implant at position 11 presented severe periimplantitis and soft tissue recession, which also affected the mesial part of tooth 12. Tooth 21 had a root canal treatment and a crown. After the implant extraction, a minimally invasive simultaneous bone regeneration and soft tissue graft procedure was performed to reconstruct the remaining ridge using xenograft, a collagen membrane, and a connective tissue graft (CTG). Ten months later, in order to improve the ridge profile, an augmentation procedure was carried out using a CTG. Three months later, an implant was placed and immediately loaded. Three months after loading, the right lateral incisor that still presented a mesial gingival recession was slowly extruded by orthodontic treatment until the papilla was symmetrical to the contralateral one. At the end of the orthodontic extrusion, an implant-supported crown was placed at position 11 and a tooth-supported crown delivered in place of tooth 21. A composite restoration was performed on tooth 12. One year later, the soft tissue level was almost symmetrical at incisor level and the periimplant bone level at implant 11 was stable.","",""

The degradation rates were explored through HE staining analysis at different time points (1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 28 d, 3 mice/group/time point). The influences of the two membranes on local macrophages and neovasculum were evaluated by immunofluorescence detection of F4/80 and CD31, and the mobilization effects of the two membranes on local stem cells were evaluated by immunohistochemical detection of Ki67 and CD146. For in vitro studies, mice periodontal ligament stem cells (mPDLSCs) were co-cultured with these two membrane materials, and the cell morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the gene expressions of Ki67, Cxcl1, Ccl1, Tnfa were investigated by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results: The results of in vivo studies showed that by day 28, there was no significant difference in degradation rate between these two membrane materials [SIS degradation rate: (16.84±4.00) %, Bio-Gide degradation rate: (24.07±3.97) %, P=0.090], illustrating that both of them could maintain the barrier effects for more than one month.

Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) addresses these defects using barrier membranes that block soft tissue infiltration and promote bone growth. CollaTape®, a type I bovine collagen membrane, is widely used for its biocompatibility and resorbability, though its bioactivity and antibacterial properties could be improved. This study compares two functionalization methods for enhancing CollaTape® membranes: adsorption of GBMP1α peptide (a BMP-2 biomimetic) and covalent anchoring of its analogue Aoa-GBMP1α. Both functionalizations were performed at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/mL. Optimal conditions were selected basing on osteoblast mineralization assays and resulted to be 0.25 mg/mL for adsorption and 1.5 mg/mL for covalent binding. Peptide surface density analysis revealed values of 0.040 μmol/cm² for adsorption and 0.278 μmol/cm² for covalent anchoring. Biological assays assessed mineralization, proliferation, and gene expression (SPP1, RUNX2) in human osteoblasts, and antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. All functionalized membranes improved osteoblast activity, with adsorption showing superior results. Antibacterial tests showed slight but significant reductions in bacterial colonies, especially for adsorption. Additional mechanical tests via unconfined compression were performed to evaluate the effect of functionalization on the membranes' mechanical properties. These tests confirmed that neither functionalization method compromised the stiffness of the membrane, a critical parameter in clinical applications. Overall, peptide adsorption is a simple and clinically adaptable strategy to enhance CollaTape®'s bioactivity and antibacterial properties while maintaining their original mechanical properties.&#xD.","",""

Ultrasound evaluations were consistent with clinical measurements. Histologic analysis showed similar new bone formation between groups (group 1: 25.80% ± 15.48%; group 2: 27.89% ± 18.21%; p = 0.803). The collagenated bone graft alone yielded comparable outcomes to its combination with a collagen membrane in areas with thick buccal bone, simplifying the treatment process by reducing costs, time, and the need for additional materials. This study compared two methods for socket preservation after tooth extraction: one with a bone graft plug alone, and the other with the bone graft plug plus a collagen membrane. Twenty study participants were followed for 6 months after treatment. The hard and soft tissue changes were assessed by clinical, radiographic, ultrasound, and biopsy analyses. Both treatments demonstrated positive results, including stable ridge height and width, new bone formation, and healthy soft tissue healing. The results showed that using only the plug was just as effective as using the plug with the membrane in promoting bone regeneration. This simple approach reduces the need for additional materials, saving time and costs while achieving similar outcomes.","",""

Such collagen constructs are widely used as barrier membranes in guided tissue and bone regeneration, where controlled degradation is essential for maintaining function. Although conventional crosslinking methods extend stability, they may introduce cytotoxicity, alter mechanical behavior, or hinder tissue integration. This study evaluated whether incorporating L-serine, a polar amino acid capable of hydrogen bonding, could modulate collagen structure and slow degradation without chemical crosslinking. L-Serine was selected because its hydroxyl-containing side chain can engage in biocompatible, hydrogen-bond-mediated interactions that offer a mild, non-crosslinking means of stabilizing collagen. Collagen scaffolds, prepared by incorporating L-serine into a collagen hydrogel followed by drying, were produced with 0-40 wt% L-serine and characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and scanning electron microscopy. In vivo degradation was assessed in a subcutaneous mouse model comparing unmodified collagen, collagen containing 40 wt% L-serine, and a commercially available bilayer porcine collagen membrane (Bio-Gide®, composed of type I and III collagen), with residual area quantified by serial sonography and histological evaluation. Low-to-moderate L-serine incorporation preserved triple-helical features, while 40 wt% led to crystalline domain formation and β-sheet enrichment. L-serine-treated collagen exhibited significantly greater residual area (2.70 ± 1.45 mm2) than unmodified collagen (0.37 ± 0.22 mm2, p < 0.05), although Bio-Gide® remained the most persistent (5.64 ± 2.76 mm2). These findings demonstrate that L-serine incorporation can modulate collagen structure and degradation kinetics through a simple, aqueous, and non-crosslinking approach. The results provide preliminary feasibility data supporting amino acid-assisted tuning of collagen resorption properties and justify further evaluation using membrane-specific fabrication and application-relevant testing.","",""

Objective: To evaluate long-term bone regeneration and implant outcomes following sinus augmentation using a collagenated porcine xenograft. Methods: This paper reports a retrospective case series of three partially edentulous patients (aged 46-56 years) who underwent lateral sinus augmentation with a small-particle collagenated porcine xenograft (THE Graft™, Purgo Biologics, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea) and staged implant placement. In one case, a controlled perforation of the Schneiderian membrane was performed to access and remove a sinus mucocele, followed by repair using a resorbable collagen membrane. Core biopsies were harvested at implant placement for histology (hematoxylin-eosin, Masson-Goldner) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Clinical outcomes included surgical events, vertical bone gain, marginal bone levels, and implant survival at long-term follow-up. Results: Healing was uneventful in all cases. Mean vertical bone gain was 12.0 mm (baseline 1.33 mm to 13.33 mm final). At a mean 46.8-month follow-up (range 38.3-52.2 months), 100% of implants were functional without failure; marginal bone loss remained < 1 mm during the first year and was stable thereafter. Histology at 3.7, 4.7, and 7.5 months showed vascularized new trabecular bone intimately contacting residual xenograft particles (new bone 20-30%, residual biomaterial 30-40%, connective tissue 30-50%). TRAP-positive multinucleated giant cells at 7.5 months indicated ongoing biomaterial degradation without severe inflammatory reactions. Conclusions: Within the limits of a small case series, collagenated porcine xenograft supported predictable bone regeneration and stable long-term implant function after sinus floor elevation, with favorable histologic integration and gradual resorption.","",""

In this study, we present a multifunctional collagen membrane reinforced with micro-magnesium wires coated with metal-phenolic networks (Col-MMW), designed for guided bone regeneration (GBR). The embedded magnesium wires provide mechanical reinforcement, enhancing the membrane's structural integrity and space-maintaining capability during early healing. Concurrently, magnesium degradation enables sustained, site-specific release of H2 and magnesium ions (Mg2+), offering a synergistic strategy to modulate the osteoimmune environment. Col-MMW attenuates intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reprograms cellular metabolism from glycolysis toward oxidative phosphorylation, thereby activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2)-mediated redox balance pathway and suppressing nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway-driven inflammation. This osteoimmunometabolic reprogramming leads to a significant reduction in inflammatory responses. In vivo studies, including rat subcutaneous implantation and calvarial defect models, demonstrated that the immunoregulatory effects of Col-MMW significantly promoted osteogenesis. By integrating mechanical reinforcement with localized metabolic and immune modulation, Col-MMW redefines the design paradigm of GBR membranes. These findings highlight Col-MMW as a next-generation biomaterial that combines structural integrity with targeted osteoimmunomodulation, addressing the unmet need for intelligent biomaterials for bone repair.","",""

Berberine (BBR) has been reported to inhibit fibrosis and promote bone regeneration, yet it remains unclear whether BBR can simultaneously suppress fibroblast activity while enhancing osteogenic differentiation. This study aims to identify the optimal BBR concentration and its dual mechanisms in inhibiting fibroblast proliferation while promoting osteogenic differentiation, potentially providing an alternative to the barrier function of traditional GBR membranes. The optimal BBR concentration and its effects on fibroblast proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were evaluated in vitro. Network pharmacology and proteomics were used to investigate the potential mechanisms. A rat model of alveolar bone defects was used to evaluate the reparative effect of BBR. Seahorse analysis, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence were employed to explore BBR's regulatory effect on mitochondrial function in both cell types. BBR at 10 and 15 μM optimally promotes osteoblast dominance within the wound healing microenvironment, induces G1-phase arrest in fibroblasts, and promotes osteogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, BBR directly binds to prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2) and upregulates Ptgs2 to achieve the dual effects. In vivo, the bone regeneration effect of the BBR and Bio-Oss® (a commercial bone substitute) combination was similar to that of the Bio-Oss® and Bio-Gide® combination (a commercial collagen membrane). Furthermore, distinct COX-2 localization patterns were observed following BBR treatment, with enhanced mitochondrial localization in osteoblasts and nuclear localization in fibroblasts, coupled with altered mitochondrial energy metabolism. Our study suggests that optimal concentrations of BBR can inhibit fibroblast proliferation and promote osteogenic differentiation, thereby enhancing bone regeneration. Combined with spatial maintenance materials, BBR presents a promising alternative to traditional GBR membranes for improving clinical outcomes in oral bone augmentation and defect repair.","",""

The purpose of this flap is to optimize soft tissue healing and esthetics in these situations, permitting primary closure without buccal flap advancement. Initially, after creating the surgical access with a sulcular and a mesial releasing incision, extraction of the fractured tooth and immediate implant placement were performed. A xenograft and collagen membrane were then placed. Subsequently, a tunnel pedicled connective tissue flap was created on the palate and rotated to the buccal, covering the collagen membrane. This approach avoided the need for an additional distal releasing incision, which may compromise a source of blood supply, thereby decreasing tissue nutrition and potentially resulting in loss of vestibular depth. The tunnel allowed for positioning the pedicled connective graft submucosally, maintaining access to the blood supply via the base. The healing of the soft tissues was uneventful with adequate vascularization and rapid epithelialization. After 3 months, reentry was performed using a circular scalpel, and an implant-supported provisional prosthesis was delivered. After 30 days of tissue conditioning, a ceramic crown was placed over the osseointegrated implant, resulting in a satisfactory esthetic outcome. The new flap design, called the tunneled pedicled connective tissue flap, proved effective for alveolar soft tissue sealing, providing adequate nutrition in guided bone regeneration procedures for compromised sockets. Prospective clinical studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to understand better the potential use of this new flap design for alveolar socket sealing and alveolar ridge preservation procedures on a routine basis.","",""

When residual alveolar bone volume is insufficient, guided bone regeneration (GBR) is a widely adopted technique. While non-resorbable membranes provide structural support, they carry a higher risk of complications and require secondary surgery. Resorbable collagen membranes, offer promising biological properties and easier clinical handling, yet clinical data remain limited. This prospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of horizontal GBR using a native, non-cross-linked resorbable porcine pericardium membrane fixed with titanium pins, in conjunction with simultaneous implant placement. Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients (26 implants) with horizontal alveolar defects (<6 mm) underwent implant placement and GBR with deproteinized bovine bone mineral and a porcine pericardium collagen membrane. Horizontal bone gain and buccal bone thickness were measured at baseline and 6 months post-operatively. Post-operative complications, patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), and peri-implant tissue health were assessed up to 1 year post-loading. Results: Mean bone gain was 2.95 ± 0.95 mm, and all sites achieved a buccal bone thickness ≥ 1.5 mm. No membrane-related complications occurred. PROMs revealed low morbidity. At 1-year follow-up, marginal bone loss averaged 0.54 ± 0.7 mm, mean probing depth was 2.79 ± 0.78 mm, 92% of sites exhibited keratinized mucosa ≥ 2 mm. Conclusions: Native resorbable porcine pericardium membranes, when combined with DBBM and mechanical stabilization, seem to be effective for horizontal bone regeneration.","",""

Three pre-mineralised ELR membranes (D1, D2 and D8) and a non-mineralised (D0) membrane, along with a collagen membrane (C+) and an empty defect were randomly allocated in rabbit calvarial defects of critical size. Four weeks post-implantation the animals were euthanized and bone fill was assessed using micro CT and histological evaluation. Using micro CT, all ELR membranes led to similar bone density, as unassisted healing and healing using a resorbable collagen membrane. A trend for superior bone fill with the D2 pre-mineralised ELR membrane was observed. Histologically, at this early time-point the ELR membranes successfully guided GBR in the defects, similarly to the control collagen membrane, and additionally led to the formation of a thin woven bone layer at the top of the cranial defect bridging between the margins of the defect. As early as 4 weeks post-implantation, the ELR membranes successfully guided bone regeneration in this rabbit critical size calvarial model and a trend for superior regeneration was observed with pre-mineralised for 2 days ELR membranes. The ELR membranes led to the formation of a bony bridge parallel to the membrane suggesting bioactivity beyond occlusion of the defect. These bioactive alloplastic membranes may succesfully serve as alternatives to allogenic membranes in guided bone regeneration.","",""

In this study, we developed a biogenic collagen membrane by combining citrate (C) pretreatment and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC)-mediated mineralization and further evaluated its bone healing potential. Methods: C-CMC collagen membranes were prepared by lyophilization. The mineral composition and content were tested through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The micromorphology was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). Physical and mechanical properties, including the swelling rate, porosity, hydrophilicity, tensile strength, Young's modulus, degradation, and barrier function, were also evaluated. Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were cultured in vitro to observe their behavior. An in vivo critical-size rat calvarial defect model was used to validate the effects of the membrane on bone regeneration. Results: The C-CMC collagen membrane was successfully synthesized as a collagen-hydroxyapatite complex with intrafibrillar mineralization, exhibiting improved mechanical properties and an optimal swelling rate, porosity, hydrophilicity, and degradation rate. Additionally, the C-CMC collagen membrane promoted BMSC proliferation, adhesion, and osteogenesis while preventing epithelial cell infiltration. In vivo experiments indicated that C-CMC collagen membranes significantly stimulated bone regeneration without causing systemic toxicity. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the C-CMC collagen membrane possesses satisfactory physical and mechanical properties, along with good biocompatibility and efficacy in bone defect regeneration, making it a potential candidate for a bioactive guided bone regeneration membrane in clinical applications.","",""

This study utilized rhesus monkey models to compare the effectiveness of two techniques (pouch and non-pouch methods) in repairing large perforations, with a focus on their impact on bone regeneration. In five male rhesus monkeys, both sides of the sinus membrane were elevated and perforated. Each sinus was assigned to one of two groups: (a) the collagen membrane covered the perforated sinus membrane and all sinus walls formed a pouch (pouch Group); (b) the collagen membrane covered the perforated sinus membrane (non-pouch Group). Both sinuses were grafted with the same amount of deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM). Follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans were performed at 1 and 9 months, and all monkeys were euthanized at 9 months for micro-CT and histomorphometric analysis. The quantitative analysis of CT images showed no significant differences in the augmented height, density, and volume of grafted bone between the two groups at 1-month and 9-month follow-up. Similarly, the morphometric and histomorphometric analyses showed no significant differences. However, a notable discrepancy in bone modeling was observed between the two time points (Pgraft-resorption = 0.0227) along with a significant difference in the sphericity of new bone (Psphericity = 0.0446). The pouch technique may lead to more stable outcomes compared to the non-pouch technique, which has been documented as a promising approach to mitigate graft volume loss and enhance graft stability and aggregation. Besides, no significant difference was seen between pouch and non-pouch techniques in promoting bone regeneration for repairing perforations of the maxillary sinus membrane. This study explored two surgical techniques for repairing large perforations in the sinus membrane during dental procedures, focusing on the bone growth outcome. We compared the ""Loma Linda Pouch"" technique, which uses absorbable membrane to create a pouch that surrounds the inner surface of the sinus, to a traditional method. We measured various outcomes, including bone height, density, and overall volume, at 1 month and 9 months after surgery. Both techniques showed substantial and ideal bone growth, but the pouch method may help stabilize the bone graft and minimize graft volume loss in the long run. Importantly, both methods led to effective healing without major complications, and our findings showed that the absorbable membrane does not hinder new bone formation. These insights can assist dental professionals in selecting the most effective approach for sinus surgeries, ultimately improving the success of dental implants and enhancing patient outcomes.","",""

Six weeks after initial surgery, identical procedures were performed on the contralateral area. Healing outcomes were assessed at 6 and 12 weeks through radiographic and histomorphometric analyses. The primary outcome was the length of the root surface covered by new cementum assessed histologically and the secondary outcome included other histomorphometric and radiographic healing outcomes. Radiographically, the GTR/SCPT groups showed significantly greater new bone volume than the control group at both 6- and 12-week timepoints (p < 0.05). Histologically, specimens treated with both formulations of SCPT displayed better-organized periodontal ligaments and improved cementum formation, similar to those treated with EMD. The group with the highest concentration of SCPT (GTR/SCPT4) exhibited the greatest amount of new cementum formation. Within the limitations of this study, both formulations of SCPT demonstrated significant regenerative potential in periodontal tissues, with outcomes comparable to those of EMD treatment, suggesting SCPT's viability as an alternative bioactive agent for periodontal regeneration in class II furcation defects.

Sprouting of vessels from surrounding local bone and periosteum into such regenerated areas is an important factor for osteogenesis. However, isolating the grafted area from the overlying periosteum with a barrier membrane may affect the revascularization of the site, thus compromising new bone formation. Aim The aim of this experimental study was to perform a comparative evaluation of neoangiogenesis in bone defects filled with a bone graft and covered with a resorbable barrier membrane or a collagen fleece. Method Eighteen 2.5-3.5 kg weighing New Zealand white rabbits were used. Two circular bicortical bone defects (8 mm in diameter) were created in the calvaria of the animals and subsequently filled with a deproteinized bovine bone mineral ([DBBM]; Bio-Oss®, Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland). One grafted defect was covered with a resorbable collagen membrane (Bio-Guide®, Geistlich Pharma AG) (group A), while the other site was covered by a collagen fleece (Jason® collagen fleece, Botiss Biomaterials GmbH, Zossen, Germany) (group B). The rabbits were divided into three study groups (7, 14, and 28 days), each containing six animals. Specimens were taken, and histological and immunohistological analyses were carried out concerning the number of newly formed vessels. Results All specimens showed uneventful bone formation at 28 days. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of blood vessels for the collagen fleece group at all time periods (7, 14, and 28 days). Conclusions The results of this study indicate that covering a bone graft with a quickly resorbable biomaterial (collagen fleece) allows for a greater degree of neoangiogenesis compared to a resorbable collagen barrier membrane.","",""

As a positive control 50 ± 10% DBBM/50 ± 10% α-TCP without gelatin (PC, B1/G0) and as a negative control (NC) empty defects were chosen. All defects were covered with a collagen membrane. The samples were harvested 4 weeks post-surgically and examined by micro-CT and histomorphometric analysis. New bone formation was evident in all defects. The mineralized tissue volume was significantly higher in the four tested biomaterials than in the NC group, but lower compared to the PC group. Histomorphometry showed similar levels of bone formation in all groups, whereas only the PC group reached a significantly higher total augmentation area than that of the NC. The PC group showed significantly higher mineralized tissue density and residual material area compared to the B3/G2 group, and more residual DBBM than the four tested biomaterials. New bone formation was not significantly affected either by different DBBM:α-TCP compositional ratios nor the presence of various gelatin carriers. Similar levels of osteoconductivity indicates the presumptive use of combined products in alveolar ridge augmentation to support bone formation. Gelatin with or without glycerine may be considered for its use as a carrier to the biomaterials frequently applied in peri-implant surgery.","",""

Efforts to reduce the production of hard-to-recycle waste are becoming increasingly important to manufacturers, not only of consumer goods but also of specialized items that are difficult to manufacture, such as medical supplies, which have now become a priority for the European Union. The purpose of the study is to manufacture a novel human-purified type I collagen membrane from bone remnants typically discarded during the processing of cortico-cancellous bones in tissue banks and to evaluate its mechanical properties and effectiveness in regenerating bone-critical mandibular defects in rabbits. To prepare the novel membrane, cortico-cancellous bone chip samples from a local tissue bank were processed to isolate collagen by demineralization under agitation in HCl, cast into a silicone mold, and air-dried at room temperature and UV irradiation. The average thickness of the four batches analyzed by SEM was 37.3 μm. The average value of Young's modulus and tensile strength obtained from the specimens was 2.56 GPa and 65.43 Mpa, respectively. The membrane's efficacy was tested by creating a critical bicortical and bilateral osteoperiosteal defect in rabbit mandibles. The right-side defects were covered with the collagen membrane, while the left-side defects were left untreated as a control. Nine weeks post-surgery, clinical, radiological, and histological analyses demonstrated new bone formation in the treated areas, whereas the control sites showed no bone regeneration. This innovative approach not only contributes to sustainability in healthcare by optimizing biological waste but also exemplifies efficient resource use in line with the circular economy, offering a cost-effective, biocompatible option that could benefit national health systems.","",""

A non-crosslinked membrane was used as reference control (RF). The initial in vitro cytotoxic analyses revealed that the PC, EC, and HMDI crosslinked membranes were cytocompatible, while the GA crosslinked membrane was cytotoxic and thus selected as positive control in the further in vivo study. Cross-linking enhances the tensile strength and collagenase resistance, effectively prolonging the membrane's standing time in vivo. Using (immune-) histochemistry and histomorphometrical analyses, the cellular inflammatory responses, tissue integration and vascularization patterns at 10-, 30-, and 90-day post-implantation in a subcutaneous implantation model in rats were analyzed. The PC membrane elicited the mildest inflammatory cell levels, akin to the RF membrane, while other groups induced an M1-dominated macrophage response and numerous multinucleated giant cells throughout the study period. EC membranes maintained structural stability up to 30 days post-implantation, similar to the GA group, whereas others collapsed prematurely. Concurrent with membrane collapse, transmembrane vascularization occurred across all groups. Histopathological and histomorphometry results reveal the intricate interplay of inflammatory cell populations in vascularization. These findings offer valuable insights into the pivotal role of cross-linkers in modulating mechanical properties and tissue responses of collagen membranes.","",""

Additionally, the augmented ridge dimensions and new bone formation were assessed radiographically and histologically at 8 weeks after surgery. The dimensions of the socket entrance gradually decreased in the open group, and wound epithelization was almost complete within 4 weeks. The mucogingival junction was maintained more apically in the open group than in the closed group (0.14 ± 0.40 mm vs. -0.86 ± 0.71 mm [mean ± SD], p < 0.05). The augmented ridge dimensions did not differ significantly between the open and closed groups (93.1% ± 5.4% vs. 88.3% ± 11.2%, p > 0.05). Histological analyses revealed no significant differences in the amount of newly formed bone. However, membrane resorption in the crestal region was more pronounced in the open group. Open and closed healing approaches for ARP in extraction sockets with damaged buccal wall resulted in similar ridge dimensions and new bone formation. However, there was less reduction of the buccal bone crest and wider keratinized tissue width after open healing.","",""

Sixty-six individuals diagnosed with peri-implantitis were randomly assigned to either GBR (34 patients) or OFD (32 patients). The OFD group served as the control, where inflamed tissue was removed and the implant surface decontaminated using 3% hydrogen peroxide, but no bone graft was placed.

Sixteen implant defects were divided into β-TCP/CS (n = 8) and DBBM/CM (n = 8). The results showed no significant differences in vertical and horizontal defect fill in millimeters between β-TCP/CS (2.87 ± 1.25 and 2.37 ± 1.06 mm, respectively) and DBBM/CM (3.5 ± 0.92 and 2.87 ± 1.12 mm, respectively).

However, β-TCP/CS exhibited greater bone alteration at the 2-mm level (BT2: -1.85 mm vs -0.47 mm) and 4-mm level (BT4: -1.79 mm vs 0.12 mm) apical to the implant platform compared to DBBM/CM. When assessing volume alteration, β-TCP/CS showed a significantly greater reduction at the platform to the 2 mm level (-61.98% vs -23.76%) than DBBM/CM. In conclusion, β-TCP/CS demonstrated promise for treating buccal bone defects around implants but exhibited higher graft reduction. This suggests that while β-tricalcium phosphate/calcium sulfate may offer clinical benefits, its potential for greater graft reduction should be considered. Further research and evaluation are warranted to fully understand the long-term implications of using β-TCP/CS in guided bone regeneration procedures.","",""

Motivated by these clinical observations, we designed a collagen-free membrane based on l-valine-co-l-phenylalanine-poly(ester urea) (PEU) copolymer via electrospinning. Degradation and mechanical properties of these membranes were performed on as-spun and water-aged samples. Alveolar-bone-derived stem cells (AvBMSCs) were seeded on the PEU BM to assess their cell compatibility and osteogenic characteristics, including cell viability, attachment/spreading, proliferation, and mineralized tissue-associated gene expression. In vivo, PEU BMs were subcutaneously implanted in rats to evaluate their potential to cause inflammatory responses and facilitate angiogenesis. Finally, critical-size calvarial defects and a periodontal model were used to assess the regenerative capacity of the electrospun PEU BM compared to clinically available Cytoflex synthetic membranes. PEU BM demonstrated equal biocompatibility to Cytoflex with superior mechanical performance in strength and elasticity. Additionally, after 14 days, PEU BM exhibited a higher expression of BGLAP/osteocalcin and superior in vivo performance-less inflammation and increased CD31 and VWF expression over time. When placed in critical-sized defects in the calvaria of rats, the PEU BM led to robust bone formation with high expression of osteogenesis and angiogenesis markers. Moreover, our membrane enhanced alveolar bone and cementum regeneration in an established periodontal model after 8 weeks. We demonstrate that the PEU BM exhibits favorable clinical properties, including mechanical stability, cytocompatibility, and facilitated bone formation in vitro and in vivo.

The comparison between OFD/PRF alone versus OFD/BG, OFD/CM, OFD/PRP, or OFD/rhBMP2 led to similar outcomes for all investigated parameters, including a reduction in PPD, VCAL/HCAL gain, and RBF. The additional incorporation of a BG to OFD/PRF only mildly improved outcomes, whereas the addition of AM improved clinical outcomes. The addition of small biomolecules such as metformin, bisphosphonates, or statins all led to significant improvements in PPD, VCAL, and HCAL when compared to OFD/PRF alone. Noteworthy, a very high heterogeneity was found in the investigated studies. The use of PRF significantly improved clinical outcomes in class II furcation defects when compared to OFD alone, with similar levels being observed between OFD/PRF and/or OFD/BG, OFD/CM, OFD/PRP, or OFD/rhBMP2. Future research geared toward better understanding potential ways to enhance the regenerative properties of PRF with various small biomolecules may prove valuable for future clinical applications. Future histological research investigating PRF in human furcation defects is largely needed. The use of PRF in conjunction with OFD statistically significantly improved PPD, VCAL, and HCAL values, yielding comparable outcomes to commonly used biomaterials. The combination of PRF to bone grafts or the addition of small biomolecules may offer additional clinical benefits, thus warranting future investigation.","",""

Subsequently, extraction of teeth and contextual guided bone regeneration was performed using porcine origin graft material and a resorbable collagen membrane to covert the defect. After 4 months, an impression was taken, and the model was scanned using a professional scanner for lab. At the same time, a cone beam computed tomography was performed to plan implant insertion through fully digital computer guided surgery. Bone was collected to perform histological and histomorphometric analysis. Pre and postoperative scans were compared using a specific software to estimate the volumetric changes. Tests were applied to investigate the relationship between the different predictor variables and the outcome variables. 14 patients were divided in 3 groups depending on the serum Vit-D levels, identifying three ranges corresponding to low (lower than 20), medium (between 20 and 30), and optimal vitamin D levels (higher than 30). Volumetric contraction after extraction was observed for all patients, without any significant difference between the groups. Focusing on the post-extraction regeneration, patients belonging to the group with lower levels of Vit-D displayed lower and more disorganized levels of bone. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that Col1A1 and Osteocalcin had no physiological alteration. Osteopontin could be identified near the external surface of bone tissue granules. Runx2 signals were detected near the margins of bone trabeculae. Serum vit-D levels do not appear to influence the extent of post-extraction bone contraction; on the contrary, they seem to influence the post-extraction regeneration. Vit D serum levels may influence the regenerative aspect during post-extraction turn-over. This might suggest controlling and (in case of low levels) recommend Vit D supplement in the patient diet in case of extraction.","",""

Bilateral calvaria defects with a diameter of 5 mm were prepared and covered with prototypes of collagen membranes (P1 or P2). The P1 membrane (positive control) presented a lower onset temperature of protein denaturation and a higher solubility than the P2 membrane (test). The contralateral defects were left uncovered (NC). After 1 and 4 weeks, the animals were euthanized. A microcomputed tomography analysis of the harvested samples was performed within and above the bony defect. Undecalcified ground sections were subjected to light microscopy and morphometric analysis. Bone formation was observed starting from the circumferential borders of the defects in all groups at 1-week of healing. The foci of ossification were observed at the periosteal and dura mater sites, with signs of collagen membrane mineralization. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. At 4 weeks, remnants of the collagen fibers were embedded in the newly formed bone. In the P2 group, significantly more bone volume, more new bone, and marrow spaces compared to the NC group were observed. Furthermore, the P2 group showed more bone volume ectocranially then the P1 group. Bone formation subjacent to a P2 membrane was superior than subjacent to the P1 membrane and significantly better compared to the control. Modifications of the physico-chemical properties may enhance the osteoconductive competence of collagen membranes, supporting bone formation outside the bony defects.","",""

Alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) is a commonly utilized technique and a variety of bone substitute materials and biologics are applied in different combinations. For this purpose, a histological evaluation and the clinical necessity of subsequent guided bone regeneration (GBR) in delayed implantations were investigated in a prospective case series after ARP with a novel deproteinized bovine bone material (95%) in combination with a species-specific collagen (5%) (C-DBBM). Notably, block-form bone substitutes without porcine collagen are limited, and moreover, the availability of histological data on this material remains limited. Ten patients, each scheduled for tooth extraction and desiring future implantation, were included in this study. Following tooth extraction, ARP was performed using a block form of C-DBBM in conjunction with a double-folded bovine cross-linked collagen membrane (xCM). This membrane was openly exposed to the oral cavity and secured using a crisscross suture. After a healing period ranging from 130 to 319 days, guided trephine drilling was performed for implant insertion utilizing static computer-aided implant surgery (s-CAIS). Cores harvested from the area previously treated with ARP were histologically processed and examined. Guided bone regeneration (GBR) was not necessary for any of the implantations. Histological examination revealed the development of a lattice of cancellous bone trabeculae through appositional membranous osteogenesis at various stages surrounding C-DBBM granules as well as larger spongy or compact ossicles with minimal remnants. The clinical follow-up period ranged from 2.5 to 4.5 years, during which no biological or technical complications occurred. Within the limitations of this prospective case series, it can be concluded that ARP using this novel C-DBBM in combination with a bovine xCM could be a treatment option to avoid the need for subsequent GBR in delayed implantations with the opportunity of a bovine species-specific biomaterial chain.","",""

The biomaterials were adapted to the apparatuses and challenged with two different monospecies bacterial culture of A. actinomycetemcomitans b and S. mutans. After 2 h, bacterial adherence and penetration were quantified by counting the number of colony-forming units (CFUs). Two specimens from each group were used for image analysis using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy. Statistical analysis was performed. Findings: The DS group had a higher adherence of S. mutans compared to A. actinomycetemcomitans b (p = 0.05). There was less adherence of A. actinomycetemcomitans b in the DS group, compared to the LP (p = 0.011) and DT (p < 0.001) groups. Only the membranes allowed penetration, which was blocked by barriers. The DT group allowed a greater penetration of S. mutans to occur compared to A. actinomycetemcomitans b (p = 0.009), which showed a higher penetration into the DS membranes compared to S. mutans (p = 0.016). The penetration of A. actinomycetemcomitans b through DS was higher compared to its penetration through DT and LP (p < 0.01 for both). DT and DS allowed a greater penetration of S. mutans to occur compared to LP, which prevented both bacterial species from penetrating.

Eighty-one defects in 75 teeth of 33 patients who completed follow-up (6.5 ± 1.4 years) were included. One tooth was lost. All defects with complete follow-up exhibited long-term average CAL gain (3.00 ± 2.00 mm, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.56-3.44 mm, p < 0.001) and PPD reduction (2.06 ± 1.91 mm, 95% CI: 1.64-2.49 mm, p < 0.001). Long-term success was achieved in 38.8% of IBDs. CAL and PPD values were comparable between 1 year and the last follow-up. Logistic regression analyses revealed that male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.07-0.75) and bleeding on probing (BOP) during supportive periodontal therapy (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.99) were risk factors for long-term success. Regenerative surgery with DBBM and RM for IBDs can achieve some degree of long-term success defined by COM. However, within this study's limitations, male sex and higher BOP incidence postoperatively are negatively associated with optimal long-term success. ChiCTR2300069016.","",""

This study presents a membrane composed of self-assembled and interpenetrating GL13K, an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) derived from a salivary protein, in a collagen membrane for antimicrobial activity and enhanced bone regeneration. Commercially available collagen membranes were immersed in GL13K solution, and self-assembly was initiated by raising the solution pH to synthesize the multifunctional membrane called COL-GL. COL-GL was composed of interpenetrating large collagen fibers and short GL13K nanofibrils, which increased hydrophobicity, reduced biodegradation from collagenase, and stiffened the matrix compared to control collagen membranes. Incorporation of GL13K led to antimicrobial and anti-fouling activity against early oral surface colonizer Streptococcus gordonii while not affecting fibroblast cytocompatibility or pre-osteoblast osteogenic differentiation. GL13K in solution also reduced macrophage inflammatory cytokine expression and increased pro-healing cytokine expression. Bone formation in a rat calvarial model was accelerated at eight weeks with COL-GL compared to the gold-standard collagen membrane based on microcomputed tomography and histology. Interpenetration of GL13K within collagen sidesteps challenges with antimicrobial coatings on bone regeneration scaffolds while increasing bone regeneration. This strength makes COL-GL a promising approach to reduce post-surgical infections and aid bone regeneration in dental and orthopedic applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The COL-GL membrane, incorporating the antimicrobial peptide GL13K within a collagen membrane, signifies a noteworthy breakthrough in bone regeneration strategies for dental and orthopedic applications. By integrating self-assembled GL13K nanofibers into the membrane, this study successfully addresses the challenges associated with antimicrobial coatings, exhibiting improved antimicrobial and anti-fouling activity while preserving compatibility with fibroblasts and pre-osteoblasts. The accelerated bone formation observed in a rat calvarial model emphasizes the potential of this innovative approach to minimize post-surgical infections and enhance bone regeneration outcomes.

Recent studies have shown that this collagen membrane has osteoconductive properties, meaning that it can support the growth of new bone. However, it has also been observed that the collagen membrane has areas of mineralized fibers which can occur spontaneously and independently of osteoblasts. To better understand how this works, we established a model using minced collagen membranes to reduce the active mineralization of intact collagen membranes in favor of passive mineralization. We thus compared the original intact membrane with a minced collagen membrane in a 5 mm calvarial defect model in Sprague Dawley rats. After three weeks of healing, histology and microcomputed tomography (μCT) were performed. Histological analysis confirmed the osteoconductive properties, with new bone growing inside the intact collagen membrane. However, in minced collagen membranes, the osteoconductive properties were restricted to the defect margins. Interestingly, histology revealed large mineralized areas indicating passive mineralization with no signs of bone formation. In the μCT analysis, the intact collagen membranes caused a higher median mineralized volume (1.5 mm3) compared with the minced group (0.4 mm3), but this lacked significance (p = 0.09). The μCT analysis needs to be interpreted carefully, particularly in defects filled with minced membranes, considering that the mineralized tissue may not necessarily be bone but also the result of passive mineralization. Taken together, the findings suggest that Bio-Gide® collagen membranes support bone formation while also exhibiting potential for passive mineralization.","",""

The calvarial defects were divided into four groups according to the particle type and the membrane application. All specimens were acquired 2 weeks (n = 5) and 8 weeks (n = 5) after surgery. According to the micro-CT results, the new bone volume increased at 2 weeks in the 76% OCP groups compared to the 90% OCP groups, and the bone volume ratio was significantly lower in the 90% OCP group after 2 weeks. The histomorphometric analysis results indicated that the new bone area and its ratio in all experimental groups were increased at 8 weeks except for the group with 90% OCP without a membrane. Furthermore, the residual bone graft area and its ratio in the 90% OCP groups were decreased at 8 weeks. In conclusion, all types of OCP could be applied as biocompatible bone graft materials regardless of its density and membrane application. Neither the OCP concentration nor the membrane application had a significant effect on new bone formation in the defect area, but the higher the OCP concentration, the less graft volume maintenance was needed.","",""

Seventy-three patients with maxillary radicular cysts were divided into two groups: one undergoing guided bone regeneration (GBR) with Bio-Oss and absorbable collagen membrane (n = 35), and the other receiving cyst excision alone (n = 38). Volumetric measurements using Amira software on CBCT scans evaluated bone regeneration, with cystic lesion shrinkage rates calculated. Intergroup comparisons utilized independent sample t-tests (P < 0.05), and linear regression analysis assessed the influence of preoperative cyst volume and group on bone healing. Both groups showed similar success rates in bone formation at the 12-month follow-up, with no significant differences between them (mean (SD), control: 75.16 (19.17) vs. GBR: 82 (20.22), P > 0.05). Linear regression analysis revealed a negative correlation between preoperative cyst volume and bone regeneration in both groups (P < 0.05). Bio-Oss may not significantly enhance bone augmentation in maxillary radicular cysts. In addition, preoperative cyst volume negatively affected the shrinkage rate of cystic lesions. Clinicians should consider patient-specific factors such as anatomy and lesion size when determining the need for bone substitute materials. Future research could focus on optimizing treatment protocols and alternative regenerative strategies to improve patient outcomes in maxillary cyst cases.","",""

A further aim was to assess the osteoinductive potential of Osteo-EVs for bone regeneration in rat calvarial defects. EVs from both groups were isolated using size-exclusion chromatography and characterized by size distribution, morphology, flow cytometry analysis and proteome profiling. The effects of EVs (10 µg/ml) on the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of cultured hMSC were evaluated. Osteo-EVs (50 µg) or serum-free medium (SFM, control) were combined with collagen membrane scaffold (MEM) to repair critical-sized calvarial bone defects in male Lewis rats and the efficacy was assessed using µCT, histology and histomorphometry.

Both groups enhance cultured hMSC proliferation and migration, but Osteo-EVs demonstrate greater efficacy in promoting in vitro osteogenic differentiation, as evidenced by increased expression of osteogenesis-related genes, and higher calcium deposition. In rat calvarial defects, MEM with Osteo-EVs led to greater and more consistent bone regeneration than MEM loaded with SFM. This study discloses differences in the protein profile and functional effects of EVs obtained from naïve hMSC and hMSC during the early stage of osteogenesis, using different methods. The significant protein profile and cellular function of EVs derived from hMSC during the early stage of osteogenesis were further verified by a calvarial bone defect model, emphasizing the importance of using differentiated MSC to produce EVs for bone therapeutics.","",""

Nevertheless, these scaffolds possess inherent limitations, such as notably compromised osteo-conductivity and osteo-inductivity. Methods: Our study focused on enhancing the mechanical properties and osteogenic bioactivities of bovine-derived collagen membranes (CMs) from the Achilles tendon by incorporating FDA-approved iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), termed as IONP-CM. Three types of IONP-CMs (IONP-CM-0.5, IONP-CM-1, and IONPCM-1.5) were constructed by altering the amounts of feeding IONPs. Results: Surface topography analysis demonstrated comparable characteristics between the IONP-CM and neat CM, with the former exhibiting augmented mechanical properties. In vitro evaluations revealed the remarkable biocompatibility of IONP-CMs toward mouse calvarial pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells, concurrently stimulating osteogenic differentiation. Mechanistic investigations unveiled that the osteogenic differentiation induced by IONP-CMs stemmed from the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, in vivo bone regeneration assessment was performed by implanting IONP-CMs into the radial defect in rabbits. Results derived from micro-computed tomography and histological analyses unequivocally substantiated the capacity of IONP-CMs to expedite bone repair processes. Discussion: IONP-CMs emerged as scaffolds boasting exceptional biocompatibility and enhanced osteogenic properties, positioning them as promising candidates for facilitating bone tissue regeneration.","",""

Tissue staining showed keratinized mucosa and new bone formation above the dental implant in the OH group. Open healing achieved healing outcomes similar to those of complete closure for collagen membrane coverage following immediate implant placements. For immediate implant placement requiring bone grafting and collagen membrane coverage, it is unnecessary to release the gingival flaps or use tissue grafts to achieve full coverage of the crestal wounds.

Two different naturally sourced membranes were evaluated in this study: (i) an intact fish skin membrane (Kerecis Oral®, Kerecis) and (ii) a porcine derived collagen (Mucograft®, Geistlich) membrane, positive control. For the in vitro experiments, human osteoprogenitor (hOP) cells were used to assess the cellular viability and proliferation at 24, 48, 72, and 168 h. ALPL, COL1A1, BMP2, and RUNX2 expression levels were analyzed by real-time PCR at 7 and 14 days. The preclinical component was designed to mimic a GBR model in canines (n = 12). The first step was the extraction of premolars (P1-P4) and the 1st molars bilaterally, thereby creating four three-wall box type defects per mandible (two per side). Each defect site was filled with bone grafting material, which was then covered with one of the two membranes (Kerecis Oral® or Mucograft®). The groups were nested within the mandibles of each subject and membranes randomly allocated among the defects to minimize potential site bias. Samples were harvested at 30-, 60-, and 90-days and subjected to computerized microtomography (μCT) for three-dimensional reconstruction to quantify bone formation and graft degradation, in addition to histological processing to qualitatively analyze bone regeneration. Neither the intact fish skin membrane nor porcine-based collagen membrane presented cytotoxic effects. An increase in cell proliferation rate was observed for both membranes, with the Kerecis Oral® outperforming the Mucograft® at the 48- and 168-hour time points. Kerecis Oral® yielded higher ALPL expression relative to Mucograft® at both 7- and 14-day points. Additionally, higher COL1A1 expression was observed for the Kerecis Oral® membrane after 7 days but no differences were detected at 14 days. The membranes yielded similar BMP2 and RUNX2 expression at 7 and 14 days. Volumetric reconstructions and histologic micrographs indicated gradual bone ingrowth along with the presence of particulate bone grafts bridging the defect walls for both Kerecis Oral® and Mucograft® membranes, which allowed for the reestablishment of the mandible shape after 90 days. New bone formation significantly increased from 30 to 60 days, and from 60 to 90 days in vivo, without significant differences between membranes. The amount of bovine grafting material (%) within the defects significantly decreased from 30 to 90 days. Collagen membranes led to an upregulation of cellular proliferation and adhesion along with increased expression of genes associated with bone healing, particularly the intact fish skin membrane. Despite an increase in the bone formation rate in the defect over time, there was no significant difference between the membranes.","",""

The anti-planktonic and anti-sessile performance of chlorhexidine on C. albicans was improved 2- to 4-fold by supplementation with citral-rich fractions. On macrophages, this fraction also exhibited a potentially cytoprotective action against the toxic effects of chlorhexidine, minimizing damage to the cell membrane, mitochondrial membrane potential, and nuclear integrity. Macrophages growing on collagen-membrane fragments and stimulated with the citral fraction (alone or with chlorhexidine) showed a significant increase in releasing the osteogenic cytokine TNF-α and enhancing the IL-4.

Various artificial membranes, especially collagen membranes (CMs) that are widely used for periodontal therapy and provide an extracellular matrix-simulating environment, play a significant role in promoting bone regeneration. In addition, numerous growth factors (GFs) have been used as clinical applications in regenerative therapy. However, it has been established that the unregulated administration of these factors may not work to their full regenerative potential and could also trigger unfavorable side effects. The utilization of these factors in clinical settings is still restricted due to the lack of effective delivery systems and biomaterial carriers. Hence, considering the efficiency of bone regeneration, both spaces maintained using CMs and GFs can synergistically create successful outcomes in bone tissue engineering. Therefore, recent studies have demonstrated a significant interest in the potential of combining CMs and GFs to effectively promote bone repair. This approach holds great promise and has become a focal point in our research. The purpose of this review is to highlight the role of CMs containing GFs in the regeneration of bone tissue, and to discuss their use in preclinical animal models of regeneration.

The addition of a barrier membrane prevents non-osteogenic tissue invasion into the bone cavity, which is key to the success of guided bone regeneration. Barrier membranes can be broadly classified as non-resorbable or resorbable. In contrast to non-resorbable membranes, resorbable barrier membranes do not require a second surgical procedure for membrane removal. Commercially available resorbable barrier membranes are either synthetically manufactured or derived from xenogeneic collagen. Although collagen barrier membranes have become increasingly popular amongst clinicians, largely due to their superior handling qualities compared to other commercially available barrier membranes, there have been no studies to date that have compared commercially available porcine-derived collagen membranes with respect to surface topography, collagen fibril structure, physical barrier property, and immunogenic composition. This study evaluated three commercially available non-crosslinked porcine-derived collagen membranes (Striate+TM, Bio-Gide® and CreosTM Xenoprotect). Scanning electron microscopy revealed similar collagen fibril distribution on both the rough and smooth sides of the membranes as well as the similar diameters of collagen fibrils. However, D-periodicity of the fibrillar collagen is significantly different among the membranes, with Striate+TM membrane having the closest D-periodicity to native collagen I. This suggests that there is less deformation of collagen during manufacturing process. All collagen membranes showed superior barrier property evidenced by blocking 0.2-16.4 μm beads passing through the membranes. To examine the immunogenic agents in these membranes, we examined the membranes for the presence of DNA and alpha-gal by immunohistochemistry. No alpha-gal or DNA was detected in any membranes. However, using a more sensitive detection method (real-time polymerase chain reaction), a relatively strong DNA signal was detected in Bio-Gide® membrane, but not Striate+TM and CreosTM Xenoprotect membranes.

Antimicrobial properties were investigated by counting colony-forming units (CFUs) of Streptococcus mitis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobaterium nucleatum on membranes and in the surrounding medium. Membranes showed no cytotoxicity. ALP activity was higher and ALP, BMP4, and OCN genes were up-regulated in DPSCs on modified membranes compared to unmodified membranes. The CFUs were reduced on modified membranes and in the medium. Modified membranes showed great biocompatibility and a high osteoinductive effect.

However, their relatively high degradation rate and lack of pro-osteogenic properties limit their clinical outcomes. It is of great importance to endow BCM with tailored degradation as well as pro-osteogenic properties. In this study, a fluoride-modified polymer-induced liquid precursor (PILP) based biomineralization strategy was used to convert the collagen membrane from an organic phase to an apatite-based inorganic phase, thus achieving enhanced anti-degradation performance as well as osteogenesis. As a result, three phases of collagen membranes were prepared. The original BCM in the organic phase induced the mildest inflammatory response and was mostly degraded after 4 weeks. The organic-inorganic mixture phase of the collagen membrane evoked a prominent inflammatory response owing to the fluoride-containing amorphous calcium phosphate (F-ACP) nanoparticles, resulting in active angiogenesis and fibrous encapsulation, whereas the inorganic phase induced a mild inflammatory response and degraded the least owing to the transition of F-ACP particles into calcium phosphate with high crystallinity. Effective control of ACP is key to building novel apatite-based barrier membranes. The current results may pave the way for the development of advanced apatite-based membranes with enhanced barrier performances.","",""

The recent progress in tissue engineering technologies and stem cell biology has significantly promoted the development of regenerative reconstruction of jawbone defects. The multiple trophic activities of extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may play a critical role in their therapeutic effects. Accumulating evidence has shown the promise of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in bone regeneration, but less is known about the regenerative effects of DPSC-EVs on jawbone defects. The purpose of this study is to explore the osteogenic effects of DPSC-EVs on jawbone marrow-derived MSCs (JB-MSCs) in vitro and their osteoinductive effects in a mandibular bone defect model in rats. Our results showed that JB-MSCs could efficiently uptake DPSC-EVs, which in turn significantly promoted the expression of osteogenic genes, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteocalcin (OCN), as well as the osteogenic differentiation capability of JB-MSCs. Meanwhile, we found that the pro-osteogenic effect in vitro induced by DPSC-EVs was comparable to that induced by BMP-2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2), currently the only Food and Drug Administration-approved osteoinductive growth factor. In vivo, animals that were locally treated with DPSC-EVs laden with a commercially available collagen membrane exhibited a relatively fast wound closure and increased new bone density at the mandible defects. Our results provide evidence for the osteogenic and osteoinductive effects of DPSC-EVs on jawbone regeneration. Due to the accessibility, rapid proliferation, and osteogenic propensity of DPSCs, DPSC-EVs may represent a safe cell-free therapeutic approach for craniofacial bone regeneration.","",""

Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was applied to the specimen after 1 week of healing, and microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and histological outcomes were analysed after 8 weeks of healing. Compared with GBR, PRF resulted in a moderate increase in the expression levels of osteoblast and osteoclast markers, osteocalcin, and calcitonin receptor. Moreover, PRF modestly increased angiogenesis and the inflammation markers vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL-6. Micro-CT and histological analyses confirmed the expected increased alveolar ridge area, with no significant differences between the three groups. Consistently, graft consolidation, as indicated by new bone formation at the defect site, did not differ significantly between groups.

Thus, biodegradable GBR membranes made of pure magnesium might be an alternative. In this study a biodegradable pure magnesium (99.95%) membrane has been proven to have all of the necessary requirements for an optimal regenerative outcome from both a mechanical and biological perspective. After implantation, the magnesium membrane separates the regenerating bone from the overlying, faster proliferating soft tissue. During the initial healing period, the membrane maintained a barrier function and space provision, whilst retaining the positioning of the bone graft material within the defect space. As the magnesium metal corroded, it formed a salty corrosion layer and local gas cavities, both of which extended the functional lifespan of the membrane barrier capabilities. During the resorption of the magnesium metal and magnesium salts, it was observed that the membrane became surrounded and then replaced by new bone. After the membrane had completely resorbed, only healthy tissue remained. The in vivo performance study demonstrated that the magnesium membrane has a comparable healing response and tissue regeneration to that of a resorbable collagen membrane.

GBR was performed using a collagen membrane and deproteinized bovine bone mineral combined with an autogenous graft at a 1:1 ratio. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed preoperatively, postoperatively, and after the patient healed. Horizontal bone width was measured on CBCT images 2 mm apical from the top of the crest. The preoperative CBCT and posthealing CBCT were superimposed to calculate the bone gain after healing, and the preoperative and postoperative CBCT scans were superimposed to calculate the bone gain after surgery. Bone loss during healing was calculated by subtracting the width of the ridge after healing from the postoperative width. The mean horizontal bone gain was significantly lower in the control group (2.7 ± 1.8 mm; 83.2%) than in the test group (5.3 ± 2.3 mm; 216.8%) (p = 0.003).

In this study, we fabricated hierarchical intrafibrillarly mineralized collagen (HIMC) membrane, comparing with collagen (COL) and extrafibrillarly mineralized collagen (EMC) membranes, HIMC membrane exhibited preferable physicochemical properties by mimicking the nanostructure of natural bone. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) seeded on HIMC membrane showed superior proliferation, adhesion, and osteogenic differentiation capacity. HIMC membrane induced CD206+Arg-1+ M2 macrophage polarization, which in turn promoted more BMSCs migration. In rat skull defects, HIMC membrane promoted the regeneration of new bone with more bone mass and more mature bone architecture.

Nevertheless, their clinical performance remains unsatisfactory because of their low mechanical strength and fast degradation rate in vivo. Although cross-linking with chemical agents is effective and reliable for prolonging the degradation time of collagen membranes, some adverse effects including potential cytotoxicity and undesirable tissue integration have been observed during this process. As a fundamental nutritional trace element, zinc plays an active role in promoting the growth of cells and regulating the degradation of the collagen matrix. Herein, a biogenic collagen membrane was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde-alendronate to prolong its degradation time. The physiochemical and biological properties were enhanced by the incorporation of zinc-doped nanohydroxyapatite (nZnHA), with the native structure of collagen preserved. Specifically, the cross-linking combined with the incorporation of 1% and 2% nZnHA seemed to endow the membrane with the most appropriate biocompatibility and tissue integration capability among the cross-linked membranes, as well as offering a degradation period of six weeks in a rat subcutaneous model. Thus, improving the clinical performance of biogenic collagen membranes by cross-linking together with the incorporation of nZnHA is a promising strategy for the improvement of biogenic collagen membranes.

In this procedure, resorbable membranes made of bovine and porcine collagen are increasingly being used, which, in addition to many possible advantages, could have the potential disadvantage of a shorter barrier functionality, especially when augmenting large-volume defects. Thus, it is of importance to evaluate the integration behavior and especially the standing time of barrier membranes using specialized methods to predict its respective biocompatibility. This study is intended to establish a new histomorphometrical analysis method to quantify the integration rate of collagen-based barrier membranes. Three commercially available barrier membranes, i.e., non-crosslinked membranes (BioGide® and Jason® membrane), a ribose-crosslinked membrane (Ossix® Plus), and a newly developed collagen-hyaluronic acid-based (Coll-HA) barrier membrane were implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of 48 6-8-week-old Wistar rats. The explants, after three timepoints (10, 30, and 60 days), were processed and prepared into histological sections for histopathological (host tissue response) and histomorphometrical (cellular invasion) analyses. 10 days after implantation, fragmentation was not evident in any of the study groups. The sections of the Coll-HA, Jason® and BioGide® membranes showed a similar mild inflammatory reaction within the surrounding tissue and an initial superficial cell immigration. Only in the Ossix® Plus group very little inflammation and no cell invasion was detected. While the results of the three commercially available membranes remained intact in the further course of the study, only fragments of the Coll-HA membrane were found 30 and 60 days after implantation. Histomorphometrically, it can be described that although initially (at 10 days post-implantation) similar results were found in all study groups, after 30 days post-implantation the cellular penetration depth of the hyaluronic acid-collagen membrane was significantly increased with time (**** p < 0.0001). Similarly, the percentage of cellular invasion per membrane thickness was also significantly higher in the Coll-HA group at all timepoints, compared to the other membranes (**** p < 0.0001). Altogether, these results show that the histomorphometrical analysis of the cellular migration can act as an indicator of integration and duration of barrier functionality. Via this approach, it was possible to semi-quantify the different levels of cellular penetration of GBR membranes that were only qualitatively analyzed through histopathological approaches before. Additionally, the results of the histopathological and histomorphometrical analyses revealed that hyaluronic acid addition to collagen does not lead to a prolonged standing time, but an increased integration of a collagen-based biomaterial. Therefore, it can only partially be used in the dental field for indications that require fast resorbed membranes and a fast cell or tissue influx such as periodontal regeneration processes.","",""

To generate them, we need to fabricate collagen membranes that are porous. However, the current fabrication method is primarily based on a bottom-up strategy, with certain limitations, such as a long manufacturing process, collagen denaturation, and failure to control fibril orientation. Using a top-down approach, we explore a novel method for constructing porous collagen membranes via the combined application of bioskiving and sonication. Numerous collagen membranes with well-aligned fibril structures were rapidly fabricated by bioskiving and then sonicated at 30, 60, 90, and 120 W for 20 min. This treatment allowed us to study the effect of power intensity on the physicochemical traits of collagen membranes. Subsequently, the prepared collagen membranes were immersed in amorphous calcium phosphate to evaluate the feasibility of mineralization. Additionally, the bioactivities of the membranes were assessed using preosteoblast cells. Tuning the power intensity was shown to modulate fibril orientation, and the porous membrane without denatured collagen could be obtained by a 20-min sonication treatment at 90 W. The prepared collagen membrane could also be further mineralized to enhance osteogenesis. Overall, this study offers a rapid and convenient approach for fabricating porous collagen membranes via bioskiving and sonication.","",""

Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin in 16 rats, while 16 healthy rats served as control. CM discs were labeled with biotin, soaked in CLHA or PBS, and implanted under the scalp. Fourteen days later, CMs were embedded in paraffin and the number of macrophages and ECs within the CMs was determined using antibodies against CD68 and transglutaminase II, respectively.

Immersion of CMs in CLHA statistically significantly reduced the number of macrophages (p < 0.0001) in diabetic rats, but not that of ECs. In the healthy group, CLHA had no significant effect on the number of either cells. Higher residual collagen area and membrane thickness in CLHA-treated CMs in diabetic animals were significantly correlated with reduced number of macrophages but not ECs.

These HPAA-crosslinked collagen membranes (HCM) have been shown to promote osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and enhance bone regeneration in vivo. Nevertheless, the biological triggers involved in those processes and the associated mechanisms are not known. Here, we identified the contribution of mitochondrial dynamics in HCM-mediated osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Mitochondriogenesis markers were significantly upregulated when MSCs were cultured on HCM, committing the MSCs to osteogenic differentiation. The mitochondria fused to form an interconnected mitochondrial network in response to the high energy requirements. Mitochondrial fission in MSCs was also triggered by HCM; fission slightly declined at 14 days to restore the equilibrium in mitochondrial dynamics. Mitophagy, another event that regulates mitochondrial dynamics, occurred actively to remove dysfunctioned mitochondria and isolate damaged mitochondria from the rest of network. The mitophagy level of MSCs was significantly elevated in the presence of HCM. Taken together, the present findings indicate that upregulation of mitochondrial dynamics via mitochondriogenesis, fusion, fission and mitophagy is responsible for HCM-mediated osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: High molecular weight polyacrylic acid (HPAA)-crosslinked collagen membrane (HCM) was found to promote in-situ bone regeneration because of it can stimulate osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Nevertheless, the biological triggers involved in those processes and associated mechanisms are not known. This study identifies that activation of mitochondrial dynamics is centrally involved in HCM-mediated osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. The HCM accelerates mitochondriogenesis and regulates homeostasis of the mitochondrial network in response to the increased energy demand for osteogenic differentiation. Concomitantly, mitophagy actively occurs to remove dysfunctioned mitochondria from the rest of the mitochondrial network. Identification of the involvement of mitophagy in HCM-mediated osteogenic differentiation of MSCs opens new vistas in the application of biomimetic mineralization in bone tissue regeneration.","",""

One of the most important characteristics of a resorbable barrier membrane is its mechanical integrity that is required for space maintenance and its tissue integration that plays a crucial role in wound healing and bone augmentation. This study compares a commercially available porcine-derived sugar-crosslinked collagen membrane with two non-crosslinked collagen barrier membranes. The material analysis provides an insight into the influence of manufacturing on the microstructure. In vivo subcutaneous implantation model provides further information on the host tissue reaction of the barrier membranes, as well as their tissue integration patterns that involve cellular infiltration, vascularization, and degradation. The obtained histochemical and immunohistochemical results over three time points (10, 30, and 60 days) showed that the tissue response to the sugar crosslinked collagen membrane involves inflammatory macrophages in a comparable manner to the macrophages observed in the surrounding tissue of the control collagen-based membranes, which were proven as biocompatible. The tissue reactions to the barrier membranes were additionally compared to wounds from a sham operation. Results suggest wound healing properties of all the investigated barrier membranes. However, the sugar-crosslinked membrane lacked in cellular infiltration and transmembraneous vascularization, providing an exclusive barrier function in GBR. Moreover, this membrane maintained a similar swelling ratio over examined timepoints, which suggests a very slow degradation pattern and supports its barrier function. Based on the study results, which showed biocompatibility of the sugar crosslinked membrane and its stability up to 60 days post-implantation, it can be concluded that this membrane may be suitable for application in GBR as a biomaterial with exclusive barrier functionality, similar to non-resorbable options.","",""

Periosteal damage as a result of traumatic injuries, infections, or surgical assistance in bone surgeries is often associated with a high incidence of delayed bone healing (union or nonunion) compounded with severe pain and a risk of a secondary fracture. Developing bioengineered functional periosteal substitutes is an indispensable approach to augment bone healing. In this study, we have developed a biomimetic periosteum membrane consisting of electrospun oxygen-releasing antioxidant polyurethane on collagen membrane (polyurethane-ascorbic acid-calcium peroxide containing fibers on collagen (PUAOCC)). Further, to assist bone formation, we have developed a bioactive inorganic-organic composite cryogel (bioglass-collagen-gelatin-nanohydroxyapatite (BCGH)) as a bone substitute. In an in vitro simulated oxidative stress model, PUAOCC supported the primary periosteal cell survival. Moreover, in an in vivo, critical-sized (5.9 mm × 3.2 mm × 1.50 mm) unicortical rat tibial bone defect, implantation of PUAOCC along with the functionalized BCGH led to significant improvement in bone formation along with periosteal regeneration. The periosteal regeneration was confirmed by expression of periosteum-specific periostin and neuronal regulation-related protein markers. Our study demonstrates the development of a periosteum-mimicking membrane with promising applications to facilitate periosteal regeneration, thus assisting bone formation when used in combination with bone composites and mimicking the natural bone repair process.","",""

By investigating the mechanism of collagen membrane-guided bone regeneration, we found compact structure and rapid membrane degradation compromised the duration of M2 macrophages influx, which restricts the recruitment of BMSCs that is essential for bone healing. To tackle this issue, a biodegrading elastomeric compound consisting of poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) and polycaprolactone (PCL) was fabricated into hierarchically porous membrane. The rational design of 3D microstructure enabled sufficient polydopamine (PDA) coating. Without any addition of growth factors, the 3D-patterned PDA membrane enables early and durable influx of M2 macrophages, which in turn promotes BMSCs recruitment and osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, 4D-morphing of the membrane fully regenerates the dome shaped calvarial bone as well as arc-shape bone in peri-implant alveolar defect without filling xenogenous substitute.

Conclusions: In this study, close values were observed between G+HY and G+CM groups. Further experimental and clinical studies with different graft materials are required to evaluate the effectiveness of HY in GBR.","",""

They were randomly divided into 3 groups, and the following procedures were performed on the sockets: (1) filled with Bio-Oss and covered by mSIS (mSIS group), (2) filled with Bio-Oss and covered by Bio-Gide (BG group), (3) natural healing (blank control group). Micro-computed tomograph (Micro-CT) was performed 4 and 12 weeks after surgery to eva-luate the new bone regeneration in the sockets of each group. The postoperative healing was uneventful in all the animals, and no complications were observed through the whole study period. Micro-CT analysis showed that the new bone fraction in the mSIS group and the BG group was significantly higher than that in the blank control group at the end of 4 weeks and 12 weeks (P < 0.05), and more new bone fraction was observed in the mSIS group than in the BG group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05).

They act as cell-occlusive devices that should maintain a micromilieu where bone tissue can grow, which in turn provides a stable bed for prosthetic implantation. However, the standing time of collagen membranes has been a challenging area, as native membranes are often prematurely resorbed. Therefore, consolidation techniques, such as chemical cross-linking, have been used to enhance the structural integrity of the membranes, and by consequence, their standing time. However, these techniques have cytotoxic tendencies and can cause exaggerated inflammation and in turn, premature resorption, and material failures. However, tissues from different extraction sites and animals are variably cross-linked. For the present in vivo study, a new collagen membrane based on bovine dermis was extracted and compared to a commercially available porcine-sourced collagen membrane extracted from the pericardium. The membranes were implanted in Wistar rats for up to 60 days. The analyses included well-established histopathological and histomorphometrical methods, including histochemical and immunohistochemical staining procedures, to detect M1- and M2-macrophages as well as blood vessels. Initially, the results showed that both membranes remained intact up to day 30, while the bovine membrane was fragmented at day 60 with granulation tissue infiltrating the implantation beds. In contrast, the porcine membrane remained stable without signs of material-dependent inflammatory processes. Therefore, the bovine membrane showed a special integration pattern as the fragments were found to be overlapping, providing secondary porosity in combination with a transmembraneous vascularization. Altogether, the bovine membrane showed comparable results to the porcine control group in terms of biocompatibility and standing time. Moreover, blood vessels were found within the bovine membranes, which can potentially serve as an additional functionality of barrier membranes that conventional barrier membranes do not provide.","",""

The collagen/Erythropoietin (EPO) scaffold exhibited significantly more rapid and complete osseous regeneration of the alveolar defect when compared to bone xenograft and the collagen membrane alone. The new EPO induced extracellular matrix was rich in Collagen I, Collagen III, Fibronectin (Fn) and E-cadherin, and featured significantly increased levels of the osteogenic transcription factors Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and Osterix (Osx). Histomorphometric evaluation revealed a significant two-fold increase in the number of capillaries between the EPO and the BioOss group. Moreover, there was a highly significant 3.5-fold higher level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the collagen/EPO-treated group compared to controls. The significant effect of EPO on VEGF, FN, and RUNX2 upregulation was confirmed in vitro, and VEGF pathway analysis using VEGF inhibitors confirmed that EPO modulated extracellular matrix protein expression through VEGF even in the absence of blood vessels.

The pore size is one of the factors that plays a key role in tissue regeneration, therefore, we evaluated the pore size of the membrane using a capillary flow porometer. Our results showed that the mean pore size of the P-C film was approximately 7-9 µm, the size known to inhibit cell migration across the membrane. The P-C film also demonstrated excellent cell viability and good biocompatibility, since the cell number increased with time, with MG-63 cells proliferating faster on the P-C film than in the cell culture flask. Furthermore, the P-C film promoted osteoblast differentiation, resulting in higher alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization.

Each hemimandible was randomly allocated to 4- or 12-week healing time after GBR, and three intervention groups were assigned by block randomization: TiO2 block: TiO2 -scaffold and a collagen membrane, DBBM particles: Deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) and a collagen membrane, Empty control: Collagen membrane only. Microcomputed tomography (microCT) was used to measure the lateral bone formation and width augmentation. Histological outcomes included descriptive analysis and histomorphometric measurements. MicroCT analysis demonstrated increasing new bone formation from 4 to 12 weeks of healing. The greatest width of mineralized bone was seen in the empty controls, and the largest lateral volume augmentation was observed in the TiO2 block sites. The DBBM particles demonstrated more mineralized bone in the grafted area than the TiO2 blocks, but small amounts and less than the empty control sites. The TiO2 blocks rendered the largest lateral volume augmentation but also less new bone formation compared with the DBBM particles. The most new lateral bone formation outward from the bone defect margins was observed in the empty controls, indicating that the presence of either graft material leads to slow appositional bone growth.","",""

Even magnesium (Mg) has been shown to constitute a favorable biomaterial for the development of stabilizing structures. However, it has been described that it is necessary to prevent premature degradation to ensure both the functionality and the biocompatibility of such Mg implants. Different coating strategies have already been developed, but most of them did not provide the desired functionality. The present study analyses a new approach based on ion implantation (II) with PVD coating for the passivation of a newly developed Mg membrane for GBR/GTR procedures. To demonstrate comprehensive biocompatibility and successful passivation of the Mg membranes, untreated Mg (MG) and coated Mg (MG-Co) were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Thereby a collagen membrane with an already shown biocompatibility was used as control material. All investigations were performed according to EN ISO 10993 regulations. The in vitro results showed that both the untreated and PVD-coated membranes were not cytocompatible. However, both membrane types fulfilled the requirements for in vivo biocompatibility. Interestingly, the PVD coating did not have an influence on the gas cavity formation compared to the uncoated membrane, but it induced lower numbers of anti-inflammatory macrophages in comparison to the pure Mg membrane and the collagen membrane. In contrast, the pure Mg membrane provoked an immune response that was fully comparable to the collagen membrane. Altogether, this study shows that pure magnesium membranes represent a promising alternative compared to the nonresorbable volume-stable materials for GBR/GTR therapy.","",""

It is suggested that platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) could improve the outcomes of regenerative procedures. Thus, this study aimed to describe the bone gain associated with GBR procedures combining membranes, bone grafts, and PRF for vertical and horizontal bone augmentation. Eighteen patients who needed vertical or horizontal bone regeneration before installing dental implants were included in the study. The horizontal bone defects were treated with a GBR protocol that includes the use of a mixture of particulate autogenous and xenogenous grafts in the proportion of 1:1, injectable form of PRF (i-PRF) to agglutinate the graft, an absorbable collagen membrane covering the regenerated region, and leukocyte PRF (L-PRF) membrane covering the GBR membrane. The vertical bone defects were treated with the same grafted mixture protected by a titanium-reinforced non-resorbable high-density polytetrafluoroethylene (d-PTFE-Ti) membrane and covered by L-PRF. The bone gain was measured using a cone-beam computed tomography at baseline and after a period of 7.5 (± 1.0) months. All patients underwent surgery to install implants after this regenerative protocol. The GBR produces an increase in bone thickness (p < 0.001) and height (p < 0.005) after treatment, with a bone gain of 5.9 ± 2.4 for horizontal defects and 5.6 ± 2.6 for vertical defects. In horizontal defects, the gain was higher in the maxilla than in mandible (p = 0.014) and in anterior than the posterior region (p = 0.033). No differences related to GBR location were observed in vertical defects (p > 0.05). GBR associated with a mixture of particulate autogenous and xenogenous grafts and i-PRF is effective for vertical and horizontal bone augmentation in maxillary and mandibular regions, permitting sufficient bone gain to future implant placement.

Guided bone regeneration (GBR), commonly used in oral and maxillofacial dental surgery, may show promise for orthopedic applications in repair of cortical bone defects. However, a limitation in the use of GBR for cortical bone defects is the lack of an ideal scaffold that provides sufficient mechanical support to bridge the cortical bone with minimal interference in the repair process. We have developed a new collagen membrane, CelGro™, for use in GBR. We report the material characterization of CelGro and evaluate the performance of CelGro in translational preclinical and clinical studies. The results show CelGro has a bilayer structure of different fiber alignment and is composed almost exclusively of type I collagen. CelGro was found to be completely acellular and free from xenoantigen, α-gal (galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose). In the preclinical study of a rabbit cortical bone defect model, CelGro demonstrated enhanced bone-remodeling activity and cortical bone healing. Microcomputed tomography evaluation showed early bony bridging over the defect area 30 days postoperatively, and nearly complete restoration of mature cortical bone at the bone defect site 60 days postoperatively. Histological analysis 60 days after surgery further confirmed that CelGro enables bridging of the cortical bone defect by induction of newly formed cortical bone. Compared to a commercially available collagen membrane, Bio-Gide®, CelGro showed much better cortical alignment and reduced porosity at the defect interface. As selection of orthopedic patients with cortical bone defects is complex, we conducted a clinical study evaluating the performance of CelGro in guided bone regeneration around dental implants. CelGro was used in GBR procedures in a total of 16 implants placed in 10 participants. Cone-beam computed tomography images show significantly increased bone formation both horizontally and vertically, which provides sufficient support to stabilize implants within 4 months. Together, the findings of our study demonstrate that CelGro is an ideal membrane for GBR not only in oral and maxillofacial reconstructive surgery but also in orthopedic applications (Clinical Trial ID ACTRN12615000027516).","",""

The degradation properties were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro degradation was performed using prepared collagenase solution. Morphology of mSIS and Bio-Gide in degradation solution were observed and the degradation rate was calculated at different time points. In in vivo experiments, nine New Zealand rabbits were used for subcutaneous implantation and were divided into three groups according to observation intervals. Six unconnected subcutaneous pouches were made on the back of each animal and were embedded with mSIS and Bio-Gide respectively. At the end of weeks 4, 8, and 12 after operation, gross observation and HE staining were used to evaluate the degree of degradation and histocompatibility. In vitro degradation experiments showed that mSIS membrane was completely degraded at the end of 12 days, while Bio-Gide was degraded at the end of 7 days. Besides, mSIS maintained its shape for longer time in the degradation solution than Bio-Gide, indicating that mSIS possessed longer degradation time, and had better ability to maintain space than Bio-Gide. In vivo biodegradation indicated that after 4 weeks of implantation, mSIS remained intact. Microscopic observation showed that collagen fibers were continuous with a few inflammatory cells that infiltrated around the membrane. Bio-Gide was basically intact and partially adhered with the surrounding tissues. HE staining showed that collagen fibers were partly fused with surrounding tissues with a small amount of inflammatory cells that infiltrated as well. Eight weeks after operation, mSIS was still intact, and was partly integrated with connective tissues, whereas Bio-Gide membrane was mostly broken and only a few residual fibers could be found under microscope. Only a small amount of mSIS debris could be observed 12 weeks after surgery, and Bio-Gide could hardly be found by naked eye and microscopic observation at the same time. In vitro degradation time of mSIS is longer than that of Bio-Gide, and the space-maintenance ability of mSIS is better.

Sham-operated rats without biomaterial displayed physiological wound healing (control group).

The membrane induced a large number of mononuclear cells over the observation period, including lymphocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts.

These cells highly expressed CD-68, calcitonin receptor, and MMP-9, but not TRAP or integrin-ß3. Thus, the membrane lost its integrity and underwent disintegration as a consequence of the induction of MNGCs. The significant increase in MNGC number correlated with a high rate of vascularization, which was significantly higher than the control group. Physiological wound healing in the control group did not induce any MNGCs at any time point. Ex vivo blood cells from liquid-PRF did not penetrate the membrane. The present study suggests a potential role for MNGCs in biomaterial degradation and questions whether it is beneficial to accept them in clinically approved biomaterials or focus on biomaterials that induce only mononuclear cells.

Scaffolds with bone-mimicking characteristics may provide an appropriate microenvironment to promote bone regeneration. Meanwhile, mechanical stimulation effectively regulates a wide range of cellular behaviors such as cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study, biomimetic multi-layer cell-collagen constructs with angle-ply structural feature were prepared by assembling micropatterned collagen membranes on which aligned MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured. The anisotropic microgrooved collagen membranes effectively guided the alignment of cells and promoted the osteogenic differentiation of them. To further promote cell differentiation and extracellular matrix production, the multi-layer cell-collagen constructs were cultured under mechanical conditioning through cyclic stretching. It was found that the constructs with both cell alignment and mechanical conditioning resulted in better osteogenic potential than those with cell alignment or mechanical conditioning alone. Upon implantation into the critical-sized calvarial defects of mice, the constructs with both cell alignment and mechanical conditioning achieved best new bone formation efficacy. Together, findings from this study reveal that synergized use of microstructural and mechanical cues may provide an effective new approach toward bone regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Biomimicking is an effective strategy to promote bone regeneration for repairing bone defects. Although numerous studies which micro-structurally mimicked native bone using various scaffolds, far less studies have paid attention to the mechanical environment of bone. In this study, angle-ply collagen membrane-supported cell sheets were prepared and pre-conditioned using mechanical loading prior to implantation at bone defects. The constructs with cell alignment and subjected to mechanical conditioning resulted in better osteogenic differentiation of cells in vitro and new bone formation in vivo than those with cell alignment or mechanical conditioning alone. Therefore, recapitulation of both microstructural and mechanical features of native bone may result in a synergistic effect and provides an effective approach toward bone regeneration.","",""

Due to the complexity and variety of clinical conditions, the healing time required for tissue regeneration varies from one case to another, which implies the need for tailoring the barrier membranes to diverse conditions via manipulating their degradation property. As a ""non-self"" biomaterial, a barrier membrane will inevitably trigger host-membrane immune response after implantation, which entails the activation of phagocytic cells. In the degradation process of a barrier membrane, the cell-mediated degradation may play a more vital role than enzymatic and physicochemical dissolution; however, limited studies have been carried out on this topic. In this context, we investigated the cell-mediated degradation and illustrated the possible key cells and mediators for immunomodulation via in vivo and in vitro studies. We discovered that IL-13, a key cytokine mainly released by T helper 2 cells (Th2), induced the formation of foreign body giant cells (FBGCs), thus resulting in membrane degradation. Neutralizing IL-13 could suppress membrane degradation and formation of FBGC. The contributions of this study are (1) unveiling the immune mechanisms underlying the cell-mediated collagen membrane degradation; (2) allowing the formation of an ""immunodegradation"" strategy to develop an ""immune-smart"" barrier membrane to manipulate its degradation; (3) providing the key regulatory immune cells and cytokines for the immunomodulation target in collagen membrane degradation.

Recently, collagen membranes have been applied in guided bone regeneration with comparable outcomes to non-resorbable membranes. Aim of this work is to provide a review on the main features, application, outcomes, and clinical employment of the different types of collagen membranes. Comparisons with non-resorbable membranes are clarified, characteristics of cross-linked collagen versus native collagen, use of different grafting materials and need for membrane fixation are explored in order to gain awareness of the indications and limits and to be able to choose the right membrane required by the clinical condition.","",""

Minimally invasive techniques for horizontal GBR have been introduced to reestablish an adequate bone volume, minimizing tissue trauma and patient morbidity. The present article describes a tunnel technique with a subperiosteal bag for horizontal GBR. A collagen membrane is partially perforated, folded, and sutured to form a bag that is filled with xenogeneic bone graft. The filled bag is inserted into a subperiosteal tunnel such that the perforated side faces the alveolar ridge and the nonperforated side faces the tunnel flap. The main advantage of this approach is the preservation of the periosteum and the enhanced blood supply to the flap, which may contribute to increased favorable wound healing and a reduced risk of flap dehiscence and membrane exposure. This novel tunnel approach for horizontal GBR using a customized bag made from a collagen membrane, specifically adapted and filled with deproteinized bovine bone, resulted in a significant ridge volume gain that allowed implant placement.","",""

To improve local conditions and achieve implant treatments, there are several methods used for increasing bone volume, among which one of the most successful, versatile, and effective is considered to be guided bone regeneration. The aim of this demonstrative study was to propose an innovative analysis protocol for the evaluation of the effect of photobiomodulation on the bone regeneration process, using rat calvarial defects of 5 mm in diameter, filled with xenograft, covered with collagen membrane, and then exposed to laser radiation. The animals were sacrificed at different points in time (i.e., after 14, 21, and 30 days). Samples of identical dimensions were harvested in order to compare the results obtained after different periods of healing. The analysis was performed by cross-linking the information obtained using histology and high-resolution synchrotron-based tomography on the same samples. A comparison was made with both the negative control (NC) group (with a bone defect which was left for spontaneous healing), and the positive control (PC) group (in which the bone defects were filled with xenografts and collagen membrane without receiving laser treatment). We demonstrated that using photobiomodulation provides a better healing effect than when receiving only the support of the biomaterial. This effect has been evident for short times treatments, i.e., during the first 14 days after surgery. The proposed analysis protocol was effective in detecting the presence of higher quantities of bone volumes under remodeling after photobiomodulation with respect to the exclusive bone regeneration guided by the xenograft.","",""

Thirty patients undergoing bone augmentation procedures at both maxillary and mandible sites were randomly treated with customized titanium meshes alone (M-, n = 15) or covered with resorbable membrane (M+, n = 15), in both cases filled with autogenous bone and xenograft. After 6 months of healing, bone tissue biopsies were taken from the augmented region. The bone tissue (B.Ar), grafting material (G.Ar), and non-mineralized tissue (NMT.Ar) areas were quantified through histomorphometric analysis, as were the osteoid area (O.Ar) and its width. Collagen membrane did not appear to significantly influence the investigated parameters: B.Ar, G.Ar, NMT.Ar, and O.Ar were similar between Group M- (34.3%, 11.5%, 54.1%, 1.95 μm2 , respectively) and Group M+ (35.3%, 14.6%, 50.2%, and 1.75 μm2 , respectively). Considering the overall population, significantly higher rates of newly formed bone were obtained in mandibular sites, while non-mineralized and dense connective tissue rates were higher in the maxilla (p < .05). The application of collagen membrane over titanium mesh did not lead to significant results. Bone formation appeared significantly different in the maxilla compared with the mandible. Additional studies are required to further investigate the issues observed.","",""

Treatments were performed with either DBBM and natural collagen membrane fixed with tacks (group A) or DBBM mixed with xHyA and subsequently covered with natural collagen membrane (group B). Clinical evaluations were made at baseline (T1), immediately after guided bone regeneration (T2), and at the time of implant placement (T3). Additionally, at the time of implant placement, core biopsies were retrieved and submitted for histologic analysis. Healing was uneventful in all cases. At 6 months, group B revealed a statistically significantly higher crestal ridge dimension compared to group A (P = .007). The histologic analysis revealed a tendency for greater mineralized tissue formation in group B compared to group A (67.5% versus 41.6%) and contained a higher amount of new bone (37.2%) and less DBBM residues (20.9%) than group A (12.8% new bone and 28.8% DBBM residues, respectively). Within their limits, the present data indicate that, during guided bone regeneration with natural collagen membrane, the combination of DBBM and xHyA may improve the quality and quantity of bone formed with DBBM alone.","",""
