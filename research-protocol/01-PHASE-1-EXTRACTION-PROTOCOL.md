## 1. PROPOLIS SOURCE SELECTION & PROCUREMENT

### 1.1 Propolis Type Selection

**Recommendation: Brazilian Green Propolis**

## 2. PROPOLIS EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY

### 2.1 Extraction Method Selection

**Selected Method: Ultrasonic-Assisted Extraction (UAE)**

**Rationale:**
- Optimal for phenolic compound extraction (literature consensus)
- Enhanced extraction efficiency vs. simple maceration (30-50% higher TPC)
- Short extraction time (30 minutes vs. overnight)
- Reproducible parameters
- Cost-effective, no special equipment requirements
- Proven in propolis literature (Pobiega et al., 2021; Bankova et al., 2021)

### 2.2 Extraction Parameters (Optimized from Literature)

**Base Parameters:**
- **Solvent**: 70% ethanol (EtOH) in ultrapure water
- **Solid-to-Liquid Ratio**: 1:10 (w/v) [e.g., 10g propolis + 100 mL solvent]
- **Temperature**: 50°C
- **Ultrasonic Power**: 40-50 kHz, 300W
- **Extraction Time**: 30 minutes

**Rationale for Each Parameter:**
- **70% EtOH**: Optimal solvent for propolis phenolics/flavonoids (better than 95% or water alone)
- **1:10 ratio**: Standard ratio yielding ~1-2% extract yield
- **50°C**: Balance between extraction efficiency and compound stability
- **30 min**: Proven time for maximum TPC extraction without degradation
- **40-50 kHz**: Standard ultrasonic frequency for botanical extraction

### 2.3 Extraction Procedure (Step-by-Step)

**Required Equipment:**
- Analytical balance (±0.001g precision)
- Ultrasonic bath (40-50 kHz, 300W, temperature control)
- Glass beakers (250-500 mL)
- Graduated cylinders
- Fine filter or cheesecloth
- Rotary evaporator (optional, for solvent recovery)
- Vacuum drying oven (or room-temperature drying)

**Extraction Protocol:**

1. **Weigh propolis powder**
   - Tare analytical balance with glass beaker
   - Weigh 10g propolis powder (±0.01g)
   - Record exact weight in batch log

2. **Prepare solvent mixture**
   - Measure 100 mL ultrapure water
   - Add 33.3 mL absolute ethanol (to create 70% v/v mixture)
   - Alternative: Use pre-made 70% EtOH solution (100 mL)
   - Total volume: 100 mL

3. **Combine and heat**
   - Transfer weighed propolis to glass beaker
   - Add 100 mL 70% EtOH solution
   - Place beaker in ultrasonic bath

4. **Ultrasonic extraction**
   - Set ultrasonic bath to 50°C temperature
   - Place beaker in bath (ensure beaker is submerged ~50%)
   - Extract for exactly 30 minutes at 40-50 kHz
   - Monitor temperature (maintain 50±2°C)
   - Note: Solution will become dark brown

5. **Cool & filter**
   - Remove beaker from ultrasonic bath
   - Allow to cool to room temperature (~20 minutes)
   - Filter through fine filter or cheesecloth into clean container
   - Transfer residue back to beaker for **second extraction** (see below)
   - Save filtrate in labeled container

6. **Second extraction (optional but recommended)**
   - Add fresh 100 mL 70% EtOH to propolis residue
   - Repeat ultrasonic extraction for 30 minutes at 50°C
   - Cool and filter (combine with first filtrate)
   - Result: Slightly higher total TPC yield (~20% improvement)

7. **Solvent removal**
   - **Option A (Preferred)**: Rotary evaporation at 45°C under vacuum until dry
     - Removes most ethanol, concentrates extract
     - Typical time: 45-60 minutes
     - Final product: Dark brown viscous concentrate
   
   - **Option B**: Air drying at room temperature
     - Place filtrate in shallow dish at 20-25°C in dark cabinet
     - Cover loosely with cheesecloth (allow ethanol evaporation)
     - Time: 7-14 days
     - Less preferred but acceptable

8. **Weigh final extract**
   - Weigh dried/concentrated extract
   - Calculate extraction yield: (extract weight / propolis weight) × 100%
   - Expected yield: 10-15% (1.0-1.5g from 10g propolis)

9. **Storage**
   - Transfer extract to dark glass vials with screw caps
   - Desiccant packet in vial
   - Store at 4°C protected from light
   - Label with: Batch ID, extraction date, mass, lot number
   - Expected shelf life: 6-12 months at 4°C

**Extraction Log Template:**

| Batch ID | Propolis Source | Propolis Weight (g) | Extract Weight (g) | Yield (%) | Date | Notes |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P-001-E1 | Supplier A | 10.05 | 1.48 | 14.7% | Jan 10, 2026 | First extraction |
| P-001-E2 | Supplier A | 10.05 | 1.32 | 13.1% | Jan 10, 2026 | Second extraction |
