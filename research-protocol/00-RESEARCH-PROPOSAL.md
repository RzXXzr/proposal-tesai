## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Research Question
Is it feasible and effective to use propolis-coated collagen membranes as a multi-functional barrier in guided bone regeneration to enhance both antimicrobial protection and osteogenic stimulation?

### Background & Rationale

Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) is a well-established regenerative technique in oral and maxillofacial surgery, utilizing resorbable membranes as compartmentalization barriers. Collagen membranes are the gold standard for GBR applications due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ease of handling. However, current limitations include:

1. **Lack of antimicrobial protection**: Collagen membranes are susceptible to bacterial colonization and biofilm formation, increasing infection risk
2. **Limited osteogenic activity**: Standard collagen membranes are biocompatible but not inherently osteoinductive
3. **Variable degradation kinetics**: Non-modified collagen membranes degrade unpredictably (4-24 weeks)

**Propolis** is a natural resinous mixture produced by honeybees with documented bioactivities:
- **Antimicrobial**: Effective against *S. aureus*, *E. coli*, *P. aeruginosa* (MIC: 1.9-7.8 μg/mL)
- **Anti-inflammatory**: Inhibits NF-κB pathway, reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines
- **Osteogenic**: Stimulates osteoblast proliferation and differentiation
- **Antioxidant**: High DPPH scavenging activity (IC50: 0.049-0.5 mg/mL)

### Preliminary Evidence

**Literature Gap Analysis:**
- 9 existing propolis-collagen combinations documented in literature
- ALL focus on **wound healing applications**, NONE specifically on GBR
- Propolis coating on medical devices: 45-171 citations (proven concept)
- Collagen membrane modifications with bioactive compounds: Established technology
- **Research Gap**: No published studies combining propolis-coated collagen membranes for GBR

**Feasibility Score: 8.5/10**
- Strong fundamental science: Both propolis and collagen membranes extensively documented
- Technical feasibility: Coating methods well-established
- Clinical relevance: Addresses real limitation of current GBR membranes
- Precedent exists: Propolis-collagen combinations proven in other applications
