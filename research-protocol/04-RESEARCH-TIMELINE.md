## CRITICAL PATH & DEPENDENCIES

**Critical Path** (longest sequence determining total project duration):

```
Phase 1 Complete (Week 13)
    ↓
Phase 2 Starts (Week 14) + Release Kinetics Run 4 weeks
    ↓
Phase 2 Complete (Week 24)
    ↓
Phase 3 Starts (Week 25) + Culture for 21 days + qPCR analysis
    ↓
Phase 3 Complete (Week 40)
    ↓
Phase 4 Starts (Week 41) + Surgery + 12-week observation + Histology
    ↓
Phase 4 Complete (Week 61 = Month 14)
```

**Key Dependencies:**
1. ✓ Phase 1 MUST complete before Phase 2 coating begins (requires extract)
2. ✓ Phase 2 MUST complete before Phase 3 cell culture begins (requires coated membranes)
3. ✓ Phase 3 MUST complete before Phase 4 animal study justification (demonstrates bioactivity)
4. ✓ Phase 4 surgical planning occurs in parallel with Phase 3 (IACUC approval needed early)

**Potential Time Savings:**
- Phases 2 & 3 can partially overlap after Phase 1 completion (e.g., start Phase 3 at Week 20 using pilot Phase 2 samples)
- Estimated overlap possible: 2-3 weeks (total project could compress to 12-13 months)

## CONTINGENCY & RISK MANAGEMENT

### Timeline Contingencies

**If Phase 1 Extraction Fails (Probability: Low)**
- Backup: Acquire certified propolis extract from commercial supplier
- Time impact: +1-2 weeks (ordering)
- Action: Activate backup supplier immediately

**If Coating Optimization Takes Longer (Probability: Medium)**
- Backup: Use preliminary coating results for Phase 3 pilot (smaller scale)
- Time impact: Negligible (Phase 3 can start with pilot samples)
- Action: Start Phase 3 with interim samples by Week 20

**If Cell Culture Contamination Occurs (Probability: Low)**
- Backup: Have fresh MC3T3-E1 cells from backup vial
- Time impact: +1-2 weeks (cell expansion)
- Action: Implement enhanced aseptic protocols immediately

**If Surgical Complications in Animal Study (Probability: Low)**
- Backup: 2 extra animals available for replacement defect sites
- Time impact: +1-2 weeks (healing period for backup)
- Action: Have contingency animals arrive 2 weeks early

**If Micro-CT Equipment Unavailable (Probability: Low)**
- Backup: Alternative 2D imaging (radiography) available
- Time impact: Additional post-processing time (+3-5 days per timepoint)
- Action: Coordinate with imaging facility early

### Schedule Buffer

**Critical activities with buffer:**
- Phase 4 surgical procedures: +2-week buffer (extra animal cohort)
- qPCR analysis: +1-week buffer (high equipment variability)
- Histomorphometry: +2-week buffer (labor-intensive)

**Total project slack**: ~3-4 weeks (built into 14-month schedule)

## CONCLUSION

This **14-month research timeline** provides a detailed, realistic schedule for the complete propolis-coated collagen membrane GBR research project, from fundamental propolis standardization through clinical-relevant in vivo validation. **Critical path analysis ensures efficient resource allocation**, with built-in contingencies for typical research delays. **Quarterly milestones enable transparent progress tracking** and early detection of issues requiring intervention.

The sequential phase structure ensures scientific validity: each phase builds on previous results, with explicit GO/NO-GO decision points preventing wasteful investment in failing approaches while enabling publication and stakeholder reporting throughout the project timeline.
