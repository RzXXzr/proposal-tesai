## TROUBLESHOOTING & RESOURCES

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Phase 1 Issues:**
- **Propolis extract variability**: Use certified supplier, maintain batch traceability
- **Low TPC values**: Adjust extraction parameters (temperature, time, solvent ratio)
- **HPLC equipment unavailable**: Partner with analytical lab for outsourced analysis

**Phase 2 Issues:**
- **Poor coating adhesion**: Improve collagen surface treatment (fibronectin coating), adjust chitosan concentration
- **Mechanical integrity loss**: Reduce propolis loading, shorten coating cycles
- **Inconsistent thickness**: Implement stricter LbL protocol, standardize immersion times

**Phase 3 Issues:**
- **Cell detachment during culture**: Use fibronectin pre-coating, avoid aggressive medium changes
- **RNA degradation**: Use RNase-free reagents, maintain cold chain, quality control RNA before qPCR
- **High qPCR background**: Treat RNA with DNase, use validated primers, optimize cycling conditions

**Phase 4 Issues:**
- **Surgical complications**: Have backup animals, trained surgical team, experienced veterinary tech
- **Equipment unavailability**: Establish partnerships early with micro-CT/histology facilities
- **Timeline slippage**: Build 3-4 week slack into schedule, prioritize critical timepoints

### Recommended Resources & Partnerships

- **HPLC Analysis**: Outsource to analytical lab ($300-500/sample) if in-house equipment unavailable
- **SEM/Microscopy**: Access via University Core Facility or partner institution
- **Animal Care**: Establish relationship with IACUC-approved vivarium 6 months before Phase 4
- **Histology**: Partner with pathology department or commercial histology service
- **qPCR**: Use core facility or partner with molecular biology lab
